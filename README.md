Welcome to the code repository of my personal website.

If you're here, that means you're probably interested in the code. Feel free to take a look around, it's nothing fancy, just a basic personal sight. I like to keep things as simple as possible. If you want to know if I can work with your team, feel free to [drop me a line](mailto:hello@acrossthekyle.com).
