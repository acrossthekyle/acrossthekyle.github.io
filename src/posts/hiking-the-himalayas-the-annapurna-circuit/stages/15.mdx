Well rest, and well fed, I departed Chromwrong the next morning for the ABC trek.
I wouldn't make it all the way, but I got pretty far on the first day, and
ended up in a place called Deurali.

It was all up today. Leaving Chomrong meant descending down to the valley floor
and then heading up the other side, which meant a lot of stress on my knees
and lungs from all this gain.

Most of the day was spent walking through jungles. About halfway in I found a
place for lunch, and ate some more pasta and had more cokes. I continued on
without much of a delay. There was a cool series of caves along the way,
with ice/snow bridges hanging over them.

At the next village it was starting to rain, and would continue to rain all the
rest of the day. I arrived at Deurali about six hours after starting the trail
today. I got a room shared with two other strangers, and set about hanging up
my wet stuff to try and get it to dry out. The showers were nice and hot though!

In the dining hall I hung out and read, and later ended up joining a group of
british people who were playing card games while eating dinner.

The next day would be Annapurna Basecamp.
