Today was a sun filled day, and we had some of the best mo-mo on trail today. It
was a day filled with varied terrain as well. We're always gaining elevation
every single day, but there's still plenty of long stretches where we're
walking on flat terrain for a while.

We made our way out of Jagat and started gaining lots of elevation. Today would
be mostly spent walking along the side of a deep valley. Plenty of little
waterfalls dotted the trail today.

After about four hours of going up and up and up, the trail too us along the
river bed of the river that we had been hiking alongside for the past two days.
Here we walked along stony beaches towards a village perched along the waters
edge. This is where we had the best mo-mo so far of the trip, and we've been
sure to have mo-mo everywhere we go since half of us were vegetarians. And it
was so darn good!

Once we left our long restful lunch, where one of the kids who lived there spent
most of the time chancing their pet rabbit around, it was time to start getting
back into the mountains once more. About two hours later and we arrived in
Dharapani. We struggled to find an affordable place to stay, but eventually
found one. The power also went in-and-out tonight at this village (apparently
this is common in the mountains of Nepal).

I can't remember much of today, partly because I didn't take many
photos nor a journal.
