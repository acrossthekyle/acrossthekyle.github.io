The storks nesting in the bell tower of the church next to the albergue
were still sleeping when the sun rose and covered the city in a warm glow. I
set out earlier than the others to take a short meandering walk through the
narrow stone streets of the old city. They took me to the east end of the
queen's bridge that led out of town.

The green-covered hills on the far side stood in contrast to the stone-made
world behind me. I turned around after crossing the bridge and took in its
beauty.

Some familiar faces called out my name and pulled me back from the trance that
the bridge was holding over me. Tania, Shelby, and Alex were just coming across
the bridge and heading out. I asked if I could join them on todays walk. They
would become my new Camino companions for the next several days.

Autumn-colored fields and hills greeted us as soon as we left the bridge behind.
However relatively flat ground was once again laid out as far as the eye could
see after crossing the highway that separated the last of the colorful hills
from the village beyond.

After a short detour through this village the landscape was full of mostly
gently rolling fields of grain, small hills, and patchworks of small farms. A
low stone wall bordered the trail on the right as it snaked its way past groves
of trees.

Breakfast was in a city called Cirauqui on a hill that rose up from the ground
in the distance. It felt medieval with walls at the base, and roads that went
in all different directions as they worked their way up from the flat ground to
the top.

Poppy fields and a rest spot with a reading area welcomed us as we left the
hilltop city behind.

We continued alongside a highway for most of the morning while going under
bridges, down into small valleys, and passing a cat on a fence trying to find
its way down. An hour later we passed under a stone bridge crossing and made
our way into Villatuerta.

At the Plaza Mayor we let our feet rest, and waited for those who were behind
us. Once the others arrived, and our bellies had some food in them, we left for
our destination and place of rest for the night.

A mountain in the distance kept its watchful eye on us as we left town and
walked out into empty fields. We took the long way around a lonely small church
standing in the middle of these fields as the dirt path slowly resolved into
the road to Estella.

On the outskirts of the city was a massive half-ruined church. I stuck my phone
through the metal gate on the side in order to photograph the smoothly rounded
pillars as they stood in the tall grasses that now covered what was once the
interior of this old building.

I rejoined the others near a map of the town on the other side of the road. It
was here that we needed to make a choice since we had arrived so early: either
keep going until we got tired and found a town to stop at, or stay here in
Estella. We decided to keep going, but the Albergue looked less than welcoming
so we turned back.

We went to the old city, which was hidden behind a stone wall and tightly packed
houses. It was much quieter here, away from the hustle and bustle of the fast
moving world several hundred feet away. Our beds were on the second floor
looking out over the street through balcony doors.

Once we had settled in, we went to the bar across the street to snack and drink.
Because today was a mostly easy one, we had arrived quite early in the
afternoon, and retreated to our beds shortly afterwards. Down in the streets
below someone was playing the Spanish guitar as we fell asleep for an afternoon
nap.

The bar across the street was still open when we woke up. We played card games
(Shelby taught us Yanev), drank some calimochos, and relaxed by the waters
edge. Afterwards we found a pizza place for a quick meal. Today was a mostly
uneventful day, and I can't wait for walks through rolling fields and clear
blue skies. Hopefully we get to experience these things tomorrow as we make for
Los Arcos.
