Galicia is paradise, and we ended up doing nearly two stages in one day just
because we wanted to beat the threat of another hot day. Myself and a couple
others from our group left together in the darkness. The fog was so dense and
thick that our headlamps could barely illuminate the way directly in front of
us.

It was a little creepy hiking through the forest with the fog and trees. We
stopped by a statue dedicated to the pilgrims at the top of another mountain,
it was an eerie sight seeing it rise out of the darkness. Two more towns came
and went in the darkness: Hospital de la Condesa and Padornelo. No lights were
on, too early for them. Passing cars reminded us where the road was.

As the sun rose the clouds ahead of us became light gray at first, then bright
white, and finally pinks followed. The clouds behind us burned as if they were
on fire. We made it to Alto do Poio for rest and food. They had a super huge
dog that begged us for attention, which I obliged. It laid its massive paw on
my arm until I fed it some table scraps, or at least I would have if the owner
hadn't called it away.

Crissi and Mauro fell into deep conversation and I fell behind as I stopped to
take pictures of the cloud subversion. I saw some of the most beautiful trees,
stones, moss and fog landscapes as I descended alone down the mountain.

Amazingly we arrived at Triacastela before noon! Sadly, the three castles here
are no more. While we ate breakfast we collectively decided to keep
going since there wasn't really anything of interest in this town, and we would
have gone crazy staying here having arrived so early in the day. Luckily the
others in our group behind us felt the same seeing as they ended up in Sarria
as well.

During our breakfast we befriended Eileen from New Zealand, whom spoke near
perfect Spansih (even Crissi was impressed), and she walked the rest of the way
with us down the mountain. Crissi and Mauro were flying down the second
mountain, I couldn't believe how fast they were going. I tried my best to keep
up. But halfway down I pulled something, and ended up inflaming a tendon in my
ankle.

Luis met up with us at some point as we began the walk in to Sarria. I used my
trekking poles as makeshift crutches and hobbled the rest of the way. Before we
ascended the stairs into the city, we stopped for a compression sock and pain
cream at the pharmacy for my tendon. Big thanks to Crissi for translating and
helping to explain what was wrong.

We found a cute Alburgue a stretch of the main road around 5pm, and felt
relieved to have a nice place to spend the night. The showers even had privacy!
We made another family dinner while watching the Nigeria and Argentina soccer
game.

Sarria is the starting point for those who can only take a week of vacation off
to do the Camino, which means it's not much farther now.
