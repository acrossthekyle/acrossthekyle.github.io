<Route />

Want to know a great way to start your day? First, buy some liquid deodorant
when you get into town at night, and in the morning when you're about leave take
it out and shake it vigorously. Keep shaking it until a stray drop finds its way
into your eye. Now that you're half-blind, and possibly puffy-eyed, reluctantly
put on your glasses. Not the best way to start what would become one of the
longest days on the camino.

At 5:30am, bound for the stretch of the Camino that some called The Wasteland,
we left Carrion and in no time at all we were walking the ancient Roman route
known as the Via Aquitana.

The green trees in the distance separated the gray world above us from the
yellow world around us, with the white gravel path never faltering as it shot
across the land.

With very little to see, or do, we kept our heads down and focused on the
walking. Luckily the clouds hung around all morning and kept the temperature
down. Some folks played their music, but mostly everyone was focused on the
destination.

And it wasn't all that bad. It only took us 3.5 hours of walking, and one stop
at a small area with benches, to reach the end of this 17 kilometer stretch in
Calzadilla de la Cueza. Believe it or not, I'm halfway to Santiago!

The clouds disappeared after breakfast in Calzadilla as we continued towards
Ledigos, and Terradillos de los Templarios. As the sun shined down upon us, the
temperatures rose.

Crissi and I were walking so fast that as we entered Ledigos we realized that we
had left Bianca behind. We waited around for her to show up, but she never did.
She most likely took a break earlier on without us noticing.

We arrived at Terradillos de los Templarios just after noon. There was a little
picnic area amongst what appeared to be the ruins of an old well, and we found
a few other pilgrims there. This was the first spot of shade since leaving
Calzadilla, so we joined them at the stone table with some cold cokes.

Terradillos was technically a stage ender, but Crissi and I were feeling
adventurous (or crazy) and decided to push on. We said our goodbyes and hit the
road once more, deciding to make it as far as Sahagún before calling it quits
for the day. If only we had known how much it was going to hurt.

We spent the next hour making bets on how much further we had to go before we
would see the next town (I lost them all), and talking about why we disliked
our jobs and what we were going to do about it. It was here that I think I
officially decided to start looking for something new.

Finally, after losing the second bet, we reached the top of a hill and spied
Moratinos sitting a kilometer away. Several stone messages, and arrows, dotted
the path as we hiked downhill into town.

They had their own little Hobbitville here which were actually Bodegas (a sign
literally said "No, Hobbits do NOT live here"). Trees wrapped in blankets
dominated the small town square in front of the church as we headed out. A few
kilometers later we came upon San Nicolás del Real Camino. A local Albergue had
an attached restaurant, which meant more sugar-filled Coca Cola, and making
sure we were ready to do the final push to Sahagún.

We arrived in the city at 4pm after taking an odd, twisting, path that took us
out of our way just so we could see an old church, and some stone statues.
Thanks Camino.

The Municipal Albergue in this city was an old church, and the beds + kitchen +
bathrooms were in the upper level/attic of the church. We got to choose our
beds before checking in and paying. This place, oddly, had the best Wi-Fi so
far on the Camino. I updated my music library later that night because
listening to the same songs for 16 days gets old, fast.

Not much was in our little area of town, and after walking 40 kilometers we were
not in the mood for exploring the city by foot. There was a small hostel cafe
across the street from the church, and Bianca walked by as we were checking it
out. We were so happy to see her, and to see that she made it safe 'n sound. By
now it was getting close to 6pm and we were overdue for our afternoon naps.

It was Sunday, and nothing was open, which meant no cooking tonight. We retired
to our beds, but ended up napping for too long. We awoke in the evening, around
8pm or so.

Crissi and I grabbed a late dinner at a large restaurant across the street, and
watched part of the world cup game. As we were leaving the restaurant Luis
found us and practically dropped to his knees. He had forgotten the passcode
for the church door and was panicking thinking that he would have to sleep
outside tonight.

Today’s walking total was 39 kilometers, the longest stretch yet. It felt as bad
as the walk into Hontanas three days earlier. I guess after a certain point the
pain is the same. For me, it usually kicks in around 20 kilometers, which in an
odd way helps me know how much ground has been covered for the day. Tomorrow is
hopefully an easier day, seeing as how we did 1.5 stages today. Our planned
destination is Mansilla, but we'll see if that actually happens.
