Today is the last official day of fully walking on the Camino Frances. Tomorrow
we will be arriving in the city that has been at the edges of our minds for
nearly 30 days. We all took a late start today. Doing nearly 45 kilometers of
total walking in one day will make you want to do that.

Boente was our first stop, for breakfast of course. According to the guide book
there was a priest here who would give blessings to pilgrims. No priest, but we
settled for the stamp since you have to get two per day now in order to get
your certificate at the end.

Several small towns came and went as we walked today. The sun was high in the
sky, and I could already feel the sunburn setting in. We were taking our time
today, and Arz√∫a was our next stop after a couple hours of walking.

There wasn't much activity on the trail today, mostly just heads-down walking.
We arrived in Arca / O Pedrouzo around 5pm. Such a slow day, but then again it
was still more than 30 kilometers of walking and we had a late start. The rain
was threatening to arrive at any moment as we tried to reconnect with Eileen
and Mauro via free WiFi at a local bar.

We tried four different places before finding beds in a hotel/Albergue called
Porta de Santiago. Not too bad of a place considering it wasn't that expensive.
Eileen and Mauro met up with us there and got some beds as well.

Apparently there is a concert going on this weekend in Santiago, so based on the
advice by Eileen we started looking into making a reservation anywhere we could
in order to ensure that we had a place to stay. But all of the Hostels and
Albergues were filling up quickly. We'll just have to wing it.

I can't believe that this month long journey is coming to an end tomorrow.
