A full month has passed since starting this journey back in France, which feels
like a world away from here, and a different time. We walked out of Santiago de
Compostela in the early morning rain. I paused, turned around, and stole a final
glimpse of the cathedral over the hills.

Another morning full of rain. But, it's been fitting these last couple of days.
After a emotional day in Santiago, we were ready to get back on The Way, and
head to Finisterre and the end of the world. The streets were mostly empty this
morning. As we walked through the plaza to head out of the city we saw several
pilgrims beginning to arrive.

It was Monday, July 2nd, and we were back in our element. I stole one last look
at the cathedral of Santiago before we headed into the wilderness. We were
surrounded by forests as we began our ascent up the hills surrounding the city.
It would be a mostly uphill hike today. And there was no shortage of small
hamlets and villages to walk through.

In fact, the entire day was filled with forests! I can't think of a time when we
weren't walking next to a river, or uphill through a thicket of trees who helped
keep the rain off of us.

We mostly marched straight through to Ponte Maceira which sat on top of a river
called RÃ­o Tambre. There was a medieval bridge here which was pretty cool to
walk around. In Finesterre you can get another certificate for completing the
walk from Santiago to there, but this meant getting more stamps again, and the
place where we would be getting our first stamp was a random restaurant on the
river. The restaurant wouldn't open for another 45 minutes, and it was the only
authorized place in town who could give the stamp, so we explored the bridge
and riverbed.

When they finally opened, we felt guilty for making them hurry while we waited
outside, so we ordered some food. Bad idea. It was a fish empanada from the
night before. Yuck. We didn't waste much time setting out as soon as we had one
bite.

Negreira was our stop for today, and it was all uphill. But it was filled with
beautiful scenery and views as we ascended. Arrival in town was fast, and we
quickly decided upon an Albergue above a bar. We had a very, very, cheap lunch:
a full burger, fries, and beer for less than 5 euros in a bar down the street.

There wasn't much to do in this town at first glance. We played some cards back
at the Alburgue before deciding to sleep off the walking from today before dinner.
I woke up to find Crissi and Mauro were gone, so I took a solo walk around town
to see what it had to offer. Tons of clothing shops, and grocery stores, which
surprised me because we've seen towns of the same size with less.

I saw my friends sitting on a bench after turning around at the end of a street,
and convinced them to get a 3-pack of ice cream bars with me. Best decision ever.
We found a cute spot for dinner and drinks. It felt very chic, like an American
cafe, and the dinner was superb. We watched the soccer game, partly because we
had nothing else to do. So far these towns after Santiago felt less Camino-ish.

It would be an early night today. It felt good to get back to walking after
taking a day off. I'm eager to get to the end, but I also want it to take
forever so that this never ends.
