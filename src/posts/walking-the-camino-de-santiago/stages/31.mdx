I walked alone in the rain for most of the day, which didn't bother me at all.
It was very calming, and put me in a great mood. Day four of rain in the
morning, and probably the third day on the entire Camino with a full day of
rain. As long as my shoes stay dry, I'm a happy camper. The goal for today was
Santa Mariña, with was about 25 kilometers away. This was because Crissi and I
were in no rush to finish since we now knew that we would have time at the end.

Old houses surrounded us as we left, and the low hanging clouds, and misting
rain, put me in the finest of moods as I walked. The others sped up while
talking, and I fell behind once more. I took as many opportunities as possible
to wander onto peoples property, trying to take good pictures, and talk to the
dogs. The dogs were unresponsive, and couldn't give two shits about me, but
the pictures, I think, turned out well.

Sheep greeted me (really they just ignored me and kept eating that grass) as I
came to A Peña two hours later. There was a cafe up the stairs, and I found
Mauro and Crissi waiting for me at the bottom of them. Another Pilgrim was
inside finishing up and about to head back out on the path. I stole
(more like asked if I could have) his leftover Spanish Tortilla. Nearly half of
it was left, waiting to be eaten. Suddenly I realized that I would have never
done something like this back home, but it felt like a no-brainer since it
would go to waste. We have become scavengers.

We continued on through the rain for another two and a half hours until
arriving in Santa Mariña. After scoping out the places to stay, and getting
some cokes, we (more like I) decided that we should keep going. This town felt
as boring as the last, was a fraction of the size, and the air contained the
constant smell of cow feces. This is a smell I will be happy to get away from
once we leave the farmlands of Galicia, and will be happy to never have to
smell again.

I put in the headphones, turned on shuffle mode, and cranked up the music for
the next two hours of rainy walking towards Olveiroa. This time it was me who
pulled ahead and the others fell behind. I don't know when this exactly happened
but I realized that they were far behind me when I came to Mallón and decided to
pause and let them catch up. I Grabbed some organce juice at the bar, and sat
outside waiting. They showed up, separately, 15 minutes later, so they weren't
too far behind me.

Beers were ordered, and we hung out for a short break. The Texans passed us
again, said they were heading to Olveiroa. The three of us decided to follow
them after our break and knock out the full stage today. We got in to town
around 3pm. With money on our minds, we checked out the cheaper Albergue but
it wasn’t that great, so we ended up going to the more expensive one.

I met up with Lauren and Hailey (the Texans) at the restaurant next to the
Albergue later in the evening. We played some card games while watching
football. Dinner was so-so, and we didn’t really do much other than hang out
at the bar watching sports. We're all planning on heading for the ocean towns of
Cee and Corcubòn tomorrow.
