I first thru-hiked the Tour du Mont Blanc (TMB) in the European Alpes back in 2018, and I had always wanted to return to it someday. In July of 2024 I made that a reality, and this time I wasn't going alone: my partner joined me on this classic European trek in order to introduce them to the hut-to-hut backpacking lifestyle.

We were treated with great weather on this trek with a couple days of rain later 
in the evening (well after we had arrived at our places of stay for the day), 
and only one day of light drizzle on us as we crossed from Italy into Switzerland.

Overall the trek was much like I remembered it, and it was a nice trip down 
memory lane as we walked along the trail. It was a bit of a struggle in some 
parts due to us living in the flat lands of Chicago, but we managed to conquer 
each tough segment and relax at the end of the day with a couple of beverages.

## Stages that we followed

We followed the same route as 2018, and stayed at nearly all of the same 
places. The only differences were La Fouly and Trient, where we stayed at 
Hotel Edelweiss and Hotel Forclaz, respectively.
