Today would be an amazing day of walking along sandy and stony beaches (not
something I had expected to run into down here), and through grassy fields. We
would be making for Refuge Chileno, which is part of the "W" portion of the "O"
Circuit, and the base of operations for anyone who wanted to hike to the Towers.

I saw some water spouts as we hiked along the beaches. This whole trek has been
nothing but amazing views! After about 90 minutes of walking it was time to
leave the water behind and head back into familiar looking territory, seeing as
we walked through this same area about a week ago when we set out from the
welcome center.

There were a lot of day hikers on the trail today, which threw us off for a
moment because we had gotten used to wide open trails and low traffic over the
past several days. Nonetheless, I was very nostalgic as this was the same
route I had day-hiked 4 years ago, nearly to the day. It brought back so many
memories, and things felt so familiar to me.

For this refuge I had booked a bunk bed because I was finishing the trek a day
earlier than I had previously planned. It was a welcomed treat after having
camped for the past six days. I did not purchase the dinner though, and made
my own backpacking meal (my last). I was not alone though as others had also
not purchased the meal, but I wish I had (it looked so delicious).

We went to bed early tonight because we were waking up at around 3 am in order
to hike up to the towers in the dark in order to watch the sun rise over them.
