A successful night of sleeping once again, and even more so given the protection
from the wind by the trees and bushes around us. The ground was a little muddy,
but that's alright. I had brought a thin, cheap, groundsheet with me and after
using it last night it was already a mess and had to be tossed, but it turns out
I wouldn't need it for the rest of the trip.

Most of the morning would be spent walking up and down hilly land through
forests with the occasional lookout point here and there. There were a few river
rossings aided by wooden bridges, nothing too crazy. I thought the trail was
going towards the mountains in the distance, but instead it took a right turn
after exiting the woods and we started to hike up a rocky trail.

The real treat today would be the morraine and glaciar along the way, just
before reaching Los Perros (our place for the night). It was a detour from the
main route, so not many people chose to go there, which means we had it mostly
to ourselves. It reminded me of the glacier that I hiked to when I first visited
Santiago, Chile in 2016. We waded in as far as we dared in the ice-cold waters,
and lay out on the rocks for a little while, soaking up some sun. Eventually we
had to leave and check-in at the campground in order to secure some good sites.

Los Perros campground was mostly in the woods, with all of the sites being in
muddy areas. We chose the dryest, and safest (always check for window-makers in
the trees above you), looking spots and set up our tents. More modern convenicnes
at this place as well: hot showers, bathrooms, kitchen to cook in. But it was
slightly more buggy than the last two places (probably all of the trees). There
was a river nearby where we could fill up our water, after filtering it of course.

I grabbed my book and headed out to a grassy area outside of the campground and
laid out under the sun and read for a bit. Self-entertainment during the period
of downtime between setting up camp and waiting to make dinner was a requirement.
Some read, others took naps, and others chatted. So far not a bad three days of
hiking!
