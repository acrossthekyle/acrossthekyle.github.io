What a windy night it was. Nobody got any sleep, except maybe for those who had
paid for a bunkbed inside of the refuge. Several tents had pieces bent, including
my own: one of the trekking poles bent in a strong suddent burst that sounded
like a gun going off in the distance. I had to tie some extra guywire string
around the center pole in order to secure it against any future bursts, which
worked and I was able to get another hour or two of sleep.

Such a beautiful morning though, as we came out of our tents the sun was
casting a bright pink light upon the clouds that hung out near the top of our
nearby mountain peak.

Today we would be hiking through ghost forests, and along a large lake that may
or may not be connected to the ocean currents in the distance. Los Cuernos (the
horns) were a pair of mountain peaks that dominated the area and were within
constant sight. While the mileage might be higher than yesterday, the trail is
so flat and easy to walk that we made great time. So great in fact that we
were able to do another side-trek on our way to Refugio Frances.

Valley Frances was the side trek, and it took us up behind Los Torres into
a wide circular valley that was chocked full of green forests, and interesting
rock formations on the perimeter. The trail to get there was easy to walk
and navigate. It went along a quickly flowing river, up and down over sandy and
muddy terrain, in and out of the trees. After about an hour of hiking we came
to the valley center, and did a bunch of 360's, taking it all in.

About two hours after leaving the valley, and retrieving our packs that we had
left at the entrance to the trail, we arrived at Frances. It was a campsite
perched upon a tree-covered steep sloping hill, which meant everyone got a
platform to pitch their tent on. My tent barely fit (it's got a wide base), but
I felt good about being within the trees: they would keep the winds away and we
could all sleep peacefully. The place to shower and cook was at the bottom of a
trail that went down towards the waters edge. I wasn't in the mood to go up and
down this trail very often while staying here, so I only went down there to
shower, and then later to make dinner. I'm sure there was lots to see down there,
I just wasn't in the mood.

I read for a while in my tent after dinner, but the forest gets darker faster and
before long it was time to go to sleep. Tomorrow we would be going to Chileno,
our last Refuge, and then the day after that the Towers themselves!
