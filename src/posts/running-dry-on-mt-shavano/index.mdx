<Route />

My partner wanted to join me on my (new) yearly tradition of going to Colorado
in September and make a big trip out of it since she had family in the state.
After spending a week with them it was time for us to head into the mountains
and hike some mountain peaks! We (read I) chose Mt. Shavano as our first peak
to do together. It was another easy Class 2 trail, but it had a lot of elevation
gain, somewhere in the area of 4,500 feet.

We camped at the trailhead in my small Duplex Zpacks backpacking tent. It is
technically meant for two people, but our air mattresses were pushing the sides
out and it was a cramped fit. It might be time to upgrade to a tent that is
actually meant for two people. As a result though we didn't get much sleep, and
were eager to get and get going as soon as possible. By 5:00 am we were on the
trail.

After a short, flat, part of the trail that shared some trail with the
Colorado Trail, we started to ascend over rocks and big tree roots. We passed by
some small water sources on the way up, and probably should have stopped and
chugged some water and then refilled our water bottles, but we didn't.

About two and a half hours later and we were above the trees, and taking in the
views of the area. Since this was my partners first time being above 9,000 feet,
we took it slow, watching for signs of AMS. As a result we took lots of small
breaks, each of us huffing and puffing though given that this was the first one
in over a year for me, and thanks to COVID-19 I wasn't able to go on a thru-hike
over the summer. Two hours later and we're past the tree line, usually it
doesn't take this long.

We saw maybe three people on the entire trail all day, but that makes sense
since we were out here on a Tuesday, a week after a holiday weekend. There was
little to no vegetation, not even weird looking plants, as we ascended up the
mostly rocky mountain sides.

At this point we were starting to run low on water, given that the ascent so far
had taken longer than it normally does. We reached the col between two mountains
and the summit trail after another hour. Time to begin the march to the summit.

About halfway up the summit we took a break. While we were snacking someone
was coming down from the summit and they told us that the view wasn't worth the
risk and trickyness of the summit, so after they left we decided to turn back
early, partly due to that warning but also the fact that we had mere drops of
water remaining in our bottles.

Our spirits started to drop rapidly as we went down the trail. The lack of
water made it doubly rough thanks to the rising heat from the sun blasting
down on us. After struggling for nearly three hours, and having practically
zero energy thanks to the heavy amounts of dehyrdation we were experiencing, we
finally made it down into the trees, and were maybe an hour from the car. Here
we came upon the smallest of water trickles coming out from between two rocks,
and nearly sunk to our knees in joy. We busted out our water filters, and drank
so much water.

Bodies rehydrated, we continued making our way to the car. The rest of the way
down wasn't too bad, and was only a little tricky when we got back to the rocks
and roots section at the beginning.

We were happy to be alive and back at the car finally. This was the roughest and
longest 14'er to date. The lack of water resources on the trail really made it
doubly rough.
