Way before I set foot on the Camino in Spain, I had already committed to doing
a thru-hike called the Tour du Mont Blanc. The Camino was my first time
in Europe, let alone my first thru-hike/backpacking trip ever, and yet I had
determined that I would like it so much that I would want to do another not
two months later. Sounds crazy, right?

Luckily, I was enamored with thru-hiking thanks to a great experience on the
Camino. So, even though this trip was two months away, I was already counting
down the days until I returned to Europe.

## What is the Tour du Mont Blanc

The Tour du Mont Blanc, or TMB, is a hiking route that encircles the Mont Blanc
mountain in the Alpes, passing through three different countries: France,
Italy and Switzerland. It's around 100 miles long, with a lot of elevation
gain/loss. It's also considered a classic long-distance hiking trail.

## Where I spent each night

Along the route there were places called Refuges in the mountains where I
spent the night. Amenities varied at each place, but they usually included a
bed with blankets, a full bathroom setup, and meals that can be ordered
a-la-carte. I paid full price for my bookings which meant breakfast and
dinner were included.

All of them had to be purchased in advance in order to guarantee a place to
stay.

## What I brought

I used the same gear from the Camino, and it worked out pretty well. Here's a
brief list of some of the items that I had to bring in order to make this a
successful hike:

<Checklist
  items={[
    'Sleeping bag liner',
    'Power bank',
    'Pillow',
    'Refuge outfit',
    'Hut slippers',
    'Water filter',
    'Headlamp',
    'Trekking poles',
    'Entertainment',
  ]}
/>

The refuges won't let you stay there without a sleeping bag liner (in order
to help prevent the spread of bed bugs), and slippers (i.e. some pair of
footwear other than the shoes you've been hiking in all day). Entertainment is
important because you could have a lot of free time on your hands. I brought a
book to read, and some playing cards.

## Stages that I followed

I wasn't sure what I would be able to do, physically, so I bought a guidebook
and used that to help me plan my trip. Availability also had an influence
since I booked my stays late in the booking season. Because of the variety
and locations of places to stay, I broke the route down into the stages below.

The TMB was said to be one of the most popular
long-distance walks in Europe, and they weren't kidding. There was a good
amount of people on it when I went, and I met some great people.
Backpackers/thru-hikers are definitely my kind of people. It's an awesome
feeling to be part of a larger group that is all working towards the same goal.

This thru-hike, just like the Camino, did not disapoint. The sights are
amazing, and the effort I put in during each day made every sight and sound
worth it.

I can't wait to do this one again.
