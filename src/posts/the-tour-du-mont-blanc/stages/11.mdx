I thought today was going to be an easy three hour hike across the valley
wall to the last mountain refuge for the trip. Boy, was I wrong. I took my time
leaving in the morning, and I think I was the last one to leave.I took a
leisurely pace as I get on the trail walking under ski lifts, and over gently
sloping forest paths.

There were a couple of boulder patches blocking the path, and these ones had a
much, much, steeper drop below them than the ones I had previously walked
across. The pictures don’t do it justice.

On the other side of the field of rocks lay a massive stone wall. It had no
name, and the guidebook didn’t mention it, but it was impressive. Just after
this wall we came to a red plastic pole that was in the middle of the path
ahead of us.

Some of the other hikers thought that it meant we couldn’t go that way, and
would have to take a higher alternative route. I nearly shit my pants when the
thought of having to do strenuous work today entered my mind. I thought I was
passed it all.

I started up the alternate path, walking more quickly than the others, and was
soon far ahead of them. I was nearly at the top when I looked back and saw
everyone else turning around to go along the normal path! Apparently it was
open for business. I was a little upset that I had come all this way only to
turn back, but in the end I was glad that I noticed them turning around.

As a result of this, I was now far behind everyone. But, I would quickly catch
up.

The path curved around the hillside and at certain points it looked like the
path went off into nothing. Beautiful rays of light and clouds illuminated the
trail ahead of me. At one point it looked like an asteroid was about to strike
the mountain due to the clouds and sun playing tricks on my eyes.

A short while later I came to a ski lift landing area, and saw where they had
been launching all of the hang gliders! It was quite a sight to see them get
their running start and jump off of the edge without hesitation.

But now the hardest part of today would begin: climbing up to the top of Le
Brevént at 2,526m. I was not prepared for this, but took it in stride
(literally). Two hours and several more shaky rocks and ladders later I was at
the top.

It had an impressive view of Mont Blanc across the valley, and there was even a
ski lift that came all of the way up here! Even though Mont Blanc itself was
still 2,000m taller than this spot, it felt like we were even with its top.

The hike down was rough, and felt never-ending. I raced down as fast as I could
go, especially since there were lots of people talking and I wanted to enjoy
the peace and quiet.

I arrived at Bellechat two hours later, and was the first to check in. It was
such a little refuge that I thought I had made a mistake in booking it, and not
continuing down to Les Houches like everyone else. Luckily my fears were abated
when several more people started to check in over the next couple of hours.

A group of people from Holland kept my company throughout most of the evening,
telling me their life story and teaching me some more Dutch words. I never knew
so many European countries made English a required subject for all of their
years of pre-university schooling. We played card some Dutch and English games
waiting for dinner.

It was very quiet up here once all of the hikers for the day had moved on, and
the dinner was very delicious. After dinner they took turns telling stories
about their families during World War 2.

I turned in early tonight, not looking forward to actually finishing tomorrow.
