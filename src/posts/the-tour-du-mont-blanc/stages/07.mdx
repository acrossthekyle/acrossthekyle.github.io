A backpacker that we shared dinner with yesterday at Maya Joie was going
in the opposite direction, and told us about a massive waterfall after La
Fouly. I was eager to check it out, and to make today just a little harder
because, you know, gotta get the steps in!

The way out of town was a little unsure to us, but thanks to my new Catalonian
friend we found our way out. After leaving the town center, and paved road, we
were immediately walking through the forest and down towards a river crossing.

After the river crossing, which was surrounded by concrete walls and served as a
mini dam, we were back in the woods. The sun had not fully cleared the tops of
the mountains to our right as we continued Northbound and came to the path
leading to the waterfall.

What looked like a mostly flat path ended up being very steep and slippery,
thanks to the morning dew. But the journey was well worth the reward. I had to
scramble a bit near the top, just below where the water was striking the
ground. I was terrified that the slightest misstep would land me in the pool of
rocks and water below me. But I was able to get close enough to feel the water
spraying on my face.

I was tempted to stick my head into the waterfall, but scared at the last
moment. It wasn’t easy moving around up there, and I had already slipped way to
many times on the wet rocks trying to get close. I wasn’t going to push my luck
knowing my history of clumsiness.

Several of the people we knew had arrived at the bottom of the path as I was
beginning to make my way down. We all walked together for the rest of the day.

Most of the path went along a massive dried up river, twisting and winding it’s
way through the forest. Several times the trail would leave no room for error
as we crossed narrow paths which sometimes had a chain to hold on to, and a
nice 100 foot drop below you.

After taking a right angle turn away from the valley wall, and walking down a
gently rolling path, we found ourselves entering the town of Praz-de-Fort. We
were now officially in Swiss valley villages. Small village after small village
greeted us as we walked a mostly paved path through the valley floor.

Each house was a perfect little wooden masterpiece that evoked rest and
relaxation. There was a good mix of new/modern houses, and old barn style
houses that looked like they might fall over at the slightest touch.

After the third village we decided to rest at a cute little bar/cafe in Issert.
I gave in and bought an ice cream sandwich while we sat on the porch and stared
at the greenery around us.

Now it was time to begin the steepest part of the “climb”. Really it was only
1.5 hours of going up, and probably less than 500 m in total gain. We passed a
cave along the way and ventured inside to explore.

There were also many wood carvings in the forest on this ascent. Mushrooms
(lots of mushrooms), antelope, beaver sculptures greeted us from time to time.
We even passed a spot where some locals were scaling the rocky side of a mini
mountain outcropping.

But the arrival into Campex and its lake was easy, and before long we were all
sitting down at a bar eating pizza and drinking beers. After a couple of hours
it was time to make the way to our separate places of residence for the night.

The day took a turn for the worse after leaving the lake behind and going our
separate ways for our accommodations. I got lost, four times! Well, technically
you can only get lost once, but I took four different routes to try and find
the Gite that I was going to be staying at.

My first attempt was to head up an alternate path that everyone swore would take
me to where I needed to be, but it was an alternate path that led up to the
wrong Refuge (this one was were two of the people I knew were staying).

On the way down I asked an old Swiss lady whose only advice was to wave her
hands in circles. I then tried to follow a river, because, you know, they lead
to civilization. That didn’t work, and I ended up doubling back to the place
where I had met the old Swiss lady.

Finally I ran in to a group of young adults (probably in high school) and asked
them where to go. Luckily one of them spoke enough English to point me in the
proper direction. Thank you random group of people, where ever you are!

Thankfully the Gite was a delight, and I ended up having dinner with my new
South Korean friend. He tried his best to teach me basic Korean. Sadly, the
only thing I remember is Annyeonghaseyo (roughly pronounced on-yo-his-ay-o).

It was a delightful evening to erase the scariness of getting lost, and to learn
a little bit in the process about another culture, and my fortitude in the face
of adversity.
