I decided to take a rest day before attempting Mt. Massive, the second highest
peak in the state of Colorado, and the third highest peak in the lower 48 states.
This would be my longest out-and-back trail at 14.5 miles in total distance. But
after Mt. Belford, I was ready for it.

The initial ascent on this trail was so easy! It felt like a breeze going up,
but I know it's an illusion because of the total distance. It's more of a
marathon than a sprint, if you will. But truly, the beginning of this trail
was easy. However I did get lost at one point thanks to a semi-confusing
trail marker, and I had to use my maps app and bushwhack my way back to the
trail.

I was making great time due to the ease of the initial ascent, and I was above
the treeline with roughly two hours. It was at this point that the trail would
start to get a little more difficult due to the presence of switchbacks here. But
after getting above the treeline I decided to find a nice rock to sit on and
watch the sun rise. As I did I also spotted some cloud inversion in the valley
below, pretty cool stuff. I didn't stay long, maybe 20-39 minutes, because it
was actually still pretty cold in this area.

After moving on my progress was slower than it had been at the beginning. The
trail is now starting to get higher and higher, and the steepness is increasing.
About four hours in and I am now at the part in the trail where it really starts
to climb. It's a bit tricky at this point: there's lots of tricky parts to climb
and maneuver around, some them scary with big drops off to the side.

With frequent breaks I slowly make my way up. I can now see Mt. Elbert in
the distance as it's practically right next door to this peak. I finally make
it to the ridge, and it's a long one. Maybe a mile still to go, and I'm losing
energy faster than I thought on this mostly gentle trail. After 5 hours I'm at
the top, but I didn't stay long. It wasn't too cold, just really really windy,
and I have a long way down.

The descent on this mountain was much easier than the ascent. It's never fun
thought when I get back to the treeline and have to hike through forests for the
last couple of hours. It always feels hot and stuffy to me.

It felt like it took forever to get through those trees, but I finally make it
back down the car! Wow, what a long trail, but it was a very nice one when
compared to Mt. Belford from the other day. This was a good way to end the trip!
