This was the last thru-hike on my list of places that I had first discovered
back in 2018. It was said to be the hardest of them all, but I thought "hey,
I've done the Himalays and survived, I can do anything". Boy was I wrong, this
was definitely the hardest thru-hike I have ever done. But, it was also one of
the most rewarding because it allowed me to cement what I liked and didn't like
about thru-hiking, and how I would do future hikes.

## What is the Great Hike of Corsica

The Grande Randonnee (GR) 20 is a "Great Hike" footpath that crosses the
Mediterranean island of Corsica running from north to south, described as
"one of the top trails in the world". The trail is considered to be the
most difficult of all the GR routes in Europe, and I can agree with that.

It consists of a northern part, and a southern part. The northern part,
between Calenzana and Vizzavona, is the more difficult part because of
the steep and rocky paths while the southern part, between Vizzavona and
Conca, is easier with rolling hills and green as far as the eye can see.

This particular trail is one where camping is most common form of shelter
at the various mountain huts known as "Refuges" along the trail. Each of
these Refuges provided basic services including home-cooked meals,
bathrooms, and showers. I went during the summer months of June and July
because summer is usually the best time to go since most of the refuges
are opened and staffed.

## Where I spent each night

Luckily for this thru-hike I didn't have to book anything in advance since
I was camping the whole way. All I had to do was show up, say I had a tent, and
pitch it wherever there was an open spot.

Each Refuge provided a place to cook your meals, and a full kitchen for ordering
food and meals, as well as shower and bathroom facilities.

## What I brought

For this particular trek I wanted to go as light as possible in order to have a
more pleasant time hiking over this mountainous terrain, and its narrow/steep
ledges. So I had to look at every piece of gear I currently owned and see where
I could drop the ounces. Here are some items that I purchased for this specific
trek:

<Checklist
  items={[
    'Durston X-Mid 1 tent',
    'Ultralight sleeping bag',
    'Thin sleeping pad',
    'Small power bank',
    'One trekking pole',
    'E-reader instead of a book',
    'Ultralight fleece',
    `Ultra-thin flip-flops`,
    `Tiny ultralight towel`,
    `Ultralight backpack`,
  ]}
/>

This was my first time with ultralight gear, and I learned a lot about what
worked for me, and what didn't work.

The tent worked for the most part, but you had to get the setup and pitch just
right in order for it to work, and most of the ground was too hard for stakes.
On one night the wind won and took down the tent, so I had to purchase one of
the provided heavy-duty tents at the Refuge.

The flip-flops were a bad idea as they provided zero protection from the rocky
ground. I quickly swapped those out for a thicket pair of flipflops I bought at
a shop at one of the Refuges.

A tiny towel was also a bad idea. It didn't have enough surface area for
absorbing all the water off of my body after a shower. But it did dry really
quickly.

## Stages that I followed

Since it was a show up and go, I could easily pick and choose where I wanted
to stay. I mostly followed the guidebook, especially since this turned out to be
a very tough thru-hike due to the mountainous terrain.

<Stages />

This thru-hike had its ups and downs, but overall it was a great experience. I
even formed a group of friends on the first day and we hiked together all the
way to Vizzavona, the halfway point. But we split up from there since some were
taking a rest day, and others wanted to start moving at different speeds.

After the halfway point I began combining stages due to how easy the southern
portion was, and I was eager to get to the hotels I had booked in two different
cities so that I could actually explore the place I was thru-hiking in for once!
