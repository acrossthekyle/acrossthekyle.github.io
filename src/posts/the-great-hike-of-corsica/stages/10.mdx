I slept really well last night in the hotel bed. The same thing happened again
though with my phone: it played white noise all night and it stopped charging.
Luckily I was able to get it up to 100% before leaving today. It felt really
good to sleep in. Breakfast at the hotel was as plain as the refuges, a shame.

It started raining while we ate, which delayed my start by about 1 hour.

As soon as the rain stopped I was out the door and back on trail. The trails
in the south are so much easier than the north. It was a leisurely walk along
wide, well maintained trails. All of the rivers and waterfalls were overflowing
though thanks to the heavy rains yesterday afternoon and this morning, which
made some crossings tricky (trying to keep my shoes as dry as possible).

I was up and over the Col just above the town of Vizzagona and on my way to the
first refuge after only 1.5 hours! It was really windy up there though, and I
nearly lost my hat, so I didn't stay long but I tried to take lots of photos. On
the trail up from Vizzavona I ran into orange and black lizards know as Fire
Lizards. They were decently sized, maybe as big as a soccerball.

I chugged right along though until I reached Capenelle, my original destination
for the day. But it was too early to stay here, I would have been bored, plus
it was a ski lift area and the camping was right under them, not the most ideal
if you ask me. But, this place was known for having good pizza, so I took a
break and had some. The pizza itself was huge! I had to fold the pieces to eat
it, and eat it quickly I did, it was so delicious. I took my leave of the
refuge and started on the way to the next one.

The trails were so flat and easy to walk (even with the occasional ascents and
descents). I passed by many abandoned refuges. Who knows how long they've been
this way. The route meandered through fields, zig-zagged up and down pine-wood
filled mountainsides, and switchbacked down towards deep dark forests. I had
nice sweeping views of the valley from many a place on trail today. Part of
the way required walking a road for a bit, but nothing too long. Eventually
I realized that I was alone on trail, and hadn't seen another human for a while.

It rained off and on throughout the day, but I didn't need a rain coat because
I was under trees for most of it. A very dreary day overall. I was doing good
on energy, and was powering through todays portion. It was definitely going to
be a double-stage today. After a while I started to wonder how far it was to
the next place to stay. And for a long time I was walking through a pine forest
for what seemed like ages and ages, not knowing if I was even on the right
trail anymore.

For nearly an hour I wondered this, until finally I came across an official
place to stay called Bocca di Verdi that was reachable by road, but I debated
going on simply because I wanted to be somewhere more rustic. I asked the
guardian how much further to the next refuge, and he said about 2 hours. It was
already 4:00 pm by this point and I had just done 17 miles of straight hiking
today. I opted to stay at this place.

Luckily I had also arrived just in time to order dinner. This place has log
cabins, and a fireplace in the main building! I could have rented a cabin for
myself, but the ground was flat here with tree coverage so I decided to bust
out my dry tent and let it get all wet again. After getting camp set up I went
to the main building and at first tried to read outside but it was getting
very windy and was still raining, so I read inside at a table next the fireplace.

Dinner was a lot of food! And chocolate mousse again for dessert!

The sun keeps trying to peak out from behind the clouds. I hope the weather over
the next few days is more pleasant. It's going to be windy tonight, hopefully
the tent walls won't attack me. Oh and one pair of the socks now has a heel
hole. Definitely going to toss them as soon as the trek is done.
