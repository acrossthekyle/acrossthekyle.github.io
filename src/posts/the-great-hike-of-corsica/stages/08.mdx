I slept alright last night, the wind was a pain, and I had to put my pants and a
pullover on, but overall I was alright overnight. The temperature got as low as
53ËšF, and the wind chill was probably 10+ degrees colder. Good news though: the
sleep system worked well, and the tent with its stacks under rocks also held up.

During our breakfast of jam on toast and chocolate milk (oh so healthy) I was
able to see some cloud inversion. Always a treat, to me at least. The dutch
set out before everyone else, as per usual, and the rest of our troop descended
from the refuge together.

The descent was initially very steep as we used our trekking poles as braces for
hoping down from rocky ledge to rocky ledge, and down the various switchbacks.
But eventually it became a more gradual and pleasant descent. We passed by
many waterfalls as we went, and lots of cows were in the area keeping us
company.

Just before the halfway point today we took a break at a Bergerie that sold
quiche! But, to be honest, their cheese was awful. I couldn't stomach it and
had to give it away to anyone else in our group. Their bread was descent though,
and I snacked on that.

The trail just before and after the Bergerie was amazing because it was
flat, and went through forests filled with tall trees spaced far apart. A large
river ran beside us over smooth boulders as we worked our way down. At the
"bottom" of the trail there was a bridge over the river and below this bridge
was another little swimming area. Peter And Tyezet met up with us there after
dropping their gear at the refuge and coming back down the trail. These guys
are machines! We did some swimming in the waterfall/river, and it was much much
colder than the other day of swimming. Some of us even jumped off of the bridge
into the river below, althought I wouldn't recommend this.

It would take about another hour to get up to the refuge through some gradual
and then steep hiking, mostly over a wide trail just after the bridge and then
over more narrower and rockier paths that slowly gained up the green hills
around us. The camping at the refuge is in a grassy field, so it's easier to
get a better tent pitch, but it's still not perfect. I'm thinking of seeling
this freestanding ultralight tent after this trip.

Finally, the first cold shower of the trip! I was wondering when this would
happen. The number of hot showers on this trek was too good to be true! We
played some more Liar, and another card game called Bullet. Afterwards I napped,
looking forward to dinner and this supposedly famous lasagna. Dinner was delayed
for nearly an hour after we were seated, and the lasagna was just ok, in my
opinion. Luckily we got seconds though. And dessert was chocolate mouse again!

After dinner our group said their goodbyes since we're all splitting up after
today. It was very very sad. These people were awesome, and tons of fun. Some
are doing a double tomorrow, while others are taking a rest day in the town of
Vizzagona. I had a hotel room booked there though, and I was eager to make use
of their laundry services and get all of my clothing washed.

It's gonna be a chilly night tonight.
