A chilly morning started the day, and thankfully the whole gang is moving.
Charles and Sophie debating calling it quits last night, but I offered the use
of one of my knee braces, and she accepted. I will just have to alternate my
single remaining one throughout the day. It's day seven, and that means there's
only seven more days to go. The trail has been hard and I'm enjoying it, but I'm
also starting to look forward to the hotel at the end.

Breakfast was more bread and jam, this time with some apple sauce, and some
more chocolate milk. Not the most filling, but what are ya gonna do?

We had a slow start to the day once we got going. The way out of the refuge
was back over the bridge we had come in on, and then the trail turned to the
right and headed up towards a mountain ridge pass in the far distance. Just
above the refuge was more bog-like grounds, and it was tricky once again trying
to find a way through it.

The trail went through shrubs of trees and rocks as it wound its way up the
stones towards the ridge pass. We took a wrong turn at one point and had to
double back, losing some time. The sun was rising behind this ridge, and thus
the whole trail was in dark shadow. It took us about two hours to get to the
top. We took a well-deserved break on the stony ground near the ridge pass,
with a huge dropoff danging below us.

The way down to the next, lower, ridge wasn't that bad. There were some drops
were we had to scoot down on our butts, and rely on some chains for the other
parts. We decided to take an easier lower route from there instead of taking
the harder upper route and scrambling over sharp-looking rocks.

We took a break in some shade of a large boulder after completing the lower
route, and before continuing along the trail that seemed to run for a good while
along the side of a mountain. It was chilly with the wind in the shade of this
boulder, which meant we didn't hang out here long. Overall it's very windy in
this area.

About an hour and a half later and I finished the flat section of the trail and
made it up the ascent to a snow-patch covered area with ice-cold waters perfect
for dipping your feet in. The waters were too dirty to fully get into, but they
were just right for my feet.

With cold refreshed feet I continued on towards the descent into the next refuge
for the night. The way down was a lot steeper than it looked from high above.
It was filled with switchbacks, very steep switchbacks, and waterfalls, making
the rocks extra slippery. But I made it down faster than I thought I would, and
when I went to checkin I ran into Peter and Tyezet chilling in the shaded
eating area of the refuge. Once again they had saved some spots for us.

I got the tent set up, but I could tell that it was going to be a windy night.
I still haven't figured out how to properly pitch the tent, and that's also
probably due to having to use rocks for the tent stakes at every campsite
because of the rock-hard ground. I hope they hold.

This place has Sundaes! And eggs! I ordered a plate of fries on top of fried
eggs, a coke (first of the trip), and a sundae for lunch. Super healthy, right?
I didn't care, it was amazing. It hit the spot. We played some exploding kittens,
and I read for a bit, while waiting for dinner.

Dinner was pre-assigned seating, which meant our group wouldn't be sitting
together. Bummer. I ended up eating dinner with a bunch of non-english speaking
strangers except for two other Belgians who spoke English, so I spoke with them
while we ate. Everyone is amazed that I came all the way from Chicago
specifically to do this trek. I still haven't met any other Americans though.

After dinner our gang played some more card games, one called Liar this time.
Supposedly the refuge tomorrow has amazing lasagna, so I'm definitely looking
forward to that!
