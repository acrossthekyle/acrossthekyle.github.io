Game of the day: up and down, up and down. The tent didn't attack me last night,
but things were very wet this morning. I packed up early in order to try and
make today a leisurely day given it would be another long day on trail, at nearly
8 hours. I stuffed the wet things into my bag and ate the "breakfast".

The day started off with a steep rise through woods but leveled out for a
bit and turned into bright green fields with a lovely river trickling through
it before switchbacking to a Col. It was very windy as the clouds rolled in and over me,
and I had to throw on my windbreaker, first time this trip! I made it to the
top of the Col and was presented with amazing views of the Mediterranean Sea.
The winds up here nearly knocked me over, and for some reason it was freezing
cold as well.

I passed by the refuge up here, Refuge Prati, and it just looked very "sad",
I'm glad I didn't stay here, and I found out later from a friend that it was
terrible. Apparently it was so windy that lots of people had to go into the
refuge eating area to sleep because their tents got taken out. Really great
views of the clouds rolling by as I got higher and higher though.

The views from up here were amazing. I could see for miles in every direction,
but the clouds kept coming and before too long the whole area was covered in fog.
There was a lot of ridges to walk along, and then go up and over, repeatedly. The
trail also had a lot of narrow areas that had steep drops off to the right of me.

The whole day ended up being descend then ascend then descend then ascend,
while clouds made it hard to see anything more than 30 feet in front of me.
I had to climb over a field of steep boulders that seemed like they would give
way at any moment, and doing this in the thick fog made it even more scary.

Eventually the clouds lifted and I could see the trail stretch out in front of me.
It was an amazing sight! It went along the ridge of a mountain for a while, and
then through some trees, before starting to go in circles, or so it felt. At one
point it felt like the trail was doubling back on itself around the top of a
mountain. Col after Col, and still no descent towards the refuge.

Finally a descent! And finally a view of the refuge. It's much higher up than
I thought it would be, which probably means an exposed camping area and rough
winds. Oh joy. On the way into the refuge area I had to walk past some angry
looking horses. I made sure to keep my distance.

This wasn't the best refuge on the trip, for many reasons. The host and workers
speak zero English, so I had a hard time communicating to them. Eventually I was
able to pre-pay for dinner, and since they didn't have a kitchen that you could
order things from but rather a general store I just picked up a bunch of small
random foods and retreated to a nearby picnic table to scarf them down.

While I hung out in my tent waiting for dinner the tent collapsed on me from
the string wind gusts. I reinforced all stakes with more rocks, and even tied
out four additional loop holes and guy lines. It held together for now. This
tent, while very being light weight and roomy for its size/weight, was not the
best at shedding winds.

This trek has been great, with amazing views and varied terrain, and has been
a great experience overall, but it's also been super hard technically speaking.
And some of my gear choices have been terrible. And it isn't that great once
you're all alone on it.

This place didn't have a covered eating area, or space to eat inside, so I had
to eat dinner outside in the rain. I made the decision to see if they had a
tent available for purchase. Luckily, they did. And good timing to. My tent
couldn't handle the wind and rain, even with all of the extra stakes. I had to
undo one of the extra stake-out points to be able to roll the door out of the
way in order to pack things up, and as soon as I did the tent collapsed.

I was able to load everything inside the tent into my backpack, and stuff it in
good for the quick walk to the purchased tent. The tent I brought now sits in a
corner on the other half of this purchased tent, wet and dirty. Not going to
even bother cleaning it or drying it out tonight. I will just stuff it up
tomorrow morning and see what weather the day/night brings at the next Refuge.

I'm glad I worked up the guts to ask the host for a purchased tent. It was the
best decision I could have made. Now I will chill in here while the rain rages
outside. I can't fully stretch out in this new tent thought, apparently it was
built for smaller people. I feel alone, sequestered in this tent tucked into a
corner next to the dormitory. This refuge sucks, but I'm thankful for this tent.

Instead of being a sad sack in here I decided to turn my mood up. I did my
evening bathroom business, brushed my teeth, and when I got back to my tent I
got busy. I popped in my headphones, turned on noise cancellation to cancel out
the storm raging outside, and the first song that popped on shuffle was "Where
Is My Mind" by Maxence Cyrin. Great song to start things off with! Then "Release
Me" by Corrina repo, followed by "Edging" by Blink-182. Not a bad set of jams to
get my head cleared out. I folded up the wet tent (it wasn't going to dry
overnight in this tiny tent anyways), got the loose gravel out of my backpack,
got everything organized into piles and set up for tomorrow morning.

After getting everything situated I started to read and then fell asleep.
