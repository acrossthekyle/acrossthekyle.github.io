Today would be easier than yesterday, as I filled myself up with a palsley
breakfast of hot chocolate milk and bread-n-butter. I was able to move quite
fast today, and was able to keep up with Charles and Sophie for nearly most of
the morning as we left the Auberge. Peter and Tyezet were already ahead of us
(they're super fast), and Dennis would meet up with us later at the hotel
campground.

The trail out of the Auberge went along a rocky trail as it curved its way
through the trees around us, and provided lots of lookout points for us to
enjoy the large expansive forested valley below. Several large dead trees
littered the ground, as we crossed over small rivers fed by waterfalls. I had
pulled ahead of the others and, knowing they would catch up to me, tried to
make as good of time as I could on this mostly flat ground before the ascent up
to a col coming up.

Sure enough, about 30 minutes later as the trail turned from rocky dirt to
solid rock and began ascending up the stone mountainside, Charles and Sophie
caught up to me, and even passed me as I took more frequent breaks than them
on the way up. Luckily though my knees were still doing great, but one of the
knee pads' velcro was starting to fail, meaning I had to keep stopping and
resetting it. Might want to look into replacing it when this trip is done.

About halfway up we stopped at a large waterfall and filled up our bottles, and
soaked our hats in the ice-cold water. Such a refreshing feeling!

We made it to the top of the col, and finished the hardest part of the trail
today by 9:00 am. Amazingly the Mediterranean Sea is still visible from these
high-up points. There was a refuge up here called Refuge Miori and we stopped
there to take a break. I had my first Orangina sugary drink, like a Fanta they
say, but on steroids. Regardless, it was delicious and gave me a nice boost of
energy.

The trail coming down from Refuge Miori was relatively easy. It was mostly dirt,
and had a nice easing slope to it. We passed a pair of cows chilling in the
bushes as we made our way down. Near the bottom I paused and looked back, wow,
such an amazing sight seeing how far we'd come in just 60 minutes.

Up ahead were a series of cascading waterfalls, and one of these cascading
areas had a large float rocky entrance, which we decided to take full advantage
of and stripped down to our underwear and went swimming in. Oh man was it cold!
Charles was brave enough to go to the top of the cascading waterfall into this
pool of water and jump. Luckily it was super deep, but I wasn't brave enough
to do that. Such a refreshing feeling!

As we continued on our way a herd of goats led by their owners started coming
down a steep mountainside and onto the trail. We were delayed for a short
while and had to move slowly as the cute little goats made their way, and their
owners tried to herd them off of the rocky trail.

After getting passed the goats we crossed a bridge and about 10 minutes later
came to a small food stand that was selling cheese-filled pancakes and
lasagna. Peter and Tyezet were already there and had been waiting for us at a
table in some shade. Charlie treated us to some of those cheese-filled pancakes
and they were so freaking delicious. I had another Orangina (I was hooked now).

Now as a nearly whole group (Dennis was still far behind us) we continued on
through lush green forests and I ended up speeding through parts of the trail
with Tyezet and we talked about various things. I like our group, they're a good
bunch of people. We had to double back at one point because Charlie and Sophie
had fallen behind without us realizing it. Sophie's legs were starting to hurt,
badly, but they made it to the hotel and campground. They (Charlie and Sophie)
ended up "giving me" their hotel room even though I begged them to take it
because of her injuries. But they really wanted to camp.

I couldn't bring my backpack up to my room due to the weird hotel rules, so I
had to stash it in a locker at the entrance, but they had a tote bag in the
locker for you to take stuff up to your room so I dumped the entire backpack
into it. It's going to make packing it up in the morning a pain, but at least I
was able to bring every up and lay it all out to be cleaned and dry.

I took a nice long shower, and washed all of my clothes in the bathroom sink. I
tried to dry them with the hairdryer but that was taking too long so I hung
everything up on hangers in the closet and put on wet boxers and a wet shirt,
with my dry joggers, and went to go hangout at the campsite with the others.
I figured my stuff would air dry while I was out there.

Charlie taught us a new card game, of which I can now not remember it or how
to play it, but we didn't get to finish it before it was time to get ready
for dinner. I stopped at the general store next to the campground on the way
back to my room and picked up some breakfast foods to eat. Breakfast at the
hotel didn't start until 7:00 am which meant a late start, and that's no good.
I bought some flip flops for the shower and for wearing around camp as well. The
ones I had brought with me weighed nothing and were super thin, which was cool
and kept my pack weight down, but they were actually horrible and couldn't
really do anything (couldn't walk around in them, push in tent stakes, etc.).

When I got back to my room I saw that other people had put their laundry on the
shared patio outside of our balconies so I moved my clothes there. It's unlikely
that they were going to dry in room since there was no air circulation. Afterwards
I chilled on my rooms own balcony, staring tt the mountains.

Finally it was time for dinner at the hotel, and four of us and bought tickets
to the dinner instead of cooking food from the general store at the campground.
This was the biggest and most delicious dinner of the trip so far. Steak with
frieds and egg salad, and dessert!

Tomorrow promises to be the easiest day so far, but we shall see
