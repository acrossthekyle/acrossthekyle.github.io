Last night was a terrifying one. Horses decided wandered into the tents area
after everyone had gone to sleep, and literally walked right past my head. It's
a good thing it was a full moon and that they could see the tents, or else
I worry what might have happened. But then dogs started barking at them,
spooking the horses and causing them to start galloping through the tents in
order to get away. I laid awake in fright for a while.

Today was the last day on trail, although I didn't quite know it yet. After
doing multiple days of double-stages I wasn't sure if I had it in me to do
nearly 20 miles today and finish, so my goal for the day was to make it to
the last refuge on trail and spend the night there. With that in mind I packed
up my stuff, and hit the trail.

The trail started off by heaving straight down from the refuge for a while and
then crossing over to the other side of the valley that the refuge was one,
and then back up for a bit before leveling out for a good long while. Here and
there were waterfalls and their rivers that required crossing, but overall
the early morning portion was mostly even ground with very little ups and downs.

First it was through a forest, and then up towards a more desert-looking
terrain with the trail being exposed to the sun for nearly the entire time.
And, sure enough, I got lost again. I must have not been paying attention to the
trail markers and probably missed a crucial one, but I ended up following a
different trail that took me in the completely wrong direction. I then had to
bushwhack a bit and make my own trail as I scrambled and climbed and worked my
way back up towards the actual trail. I got cut a couple of times by sharp
needles as I made my way.

Once back on the trail I followed it closely and kept a vigilant eye out
for markers. It now started to go up and up towards a forested area and a
large public park that had a large amount of hotels and places to stay just
down the road from it. I chose to not stop and take a break and to keep pushing
through. The trail from this point was a very wide, and flat, dirt path. Love it!

The flat trail would end eventually, and now there was a steep ascent up towards
a mountain top. It took maybe an hour to get up there. From there it was
another series of ups and downs before arriving at the last refuge on trail. I
debated spending the night here, but after scoping it out and seeing that they
too had cows and horses wandering through the area where the tents were I
decided that I had had enough of that and pushed on. I was going to finish today.

It felt like such a long rest of the day, with so many ups and downs in
elevation, and steps. My feet are killing me, and my knees. As soon as an "up"
portion of the trail came, it usually meant there would be a "down" portion again.
Up and down and up and down, over bald mountain tops and through forests.

About three hours after leaving the last refuge behind, and after many steps
and tiring ascents/descents, I came to a pass in the rocks that signaled the
beginning of the end of the trail for me. It was like a gate you had to pass
through, and it was very symbolic for me.

From here it would take about 30 minutes of racing downhill as fast as I could
go before I reached the end of the trail, and emerged from the woods onto a
paved road that led into the town of Conca, and the official end of the trek. I
collapsed as I reached the bar that signaled the end, and I ran into my first
American there! We shared a celebratory beer and then headed off into town
to find the local campground (the cheapest of the options). From there, in the
morning, I would be taking a shuttle into Porto Vecchio and I had a hotel room
there waiting for me.

This trek was the hardest I had ever done, and the most amazing. I met a lot of
great people, and made some more life-long friends! While there were struggles
both physically and mentally along the way, overall this trek helped me figure
out what kind of backpacker I want to be, and really helped me realize that I
didn't want to be a true ultralight backpacking person.

I have finally completed the list of treks I first created back in 2018. What
an amazing feeling!
