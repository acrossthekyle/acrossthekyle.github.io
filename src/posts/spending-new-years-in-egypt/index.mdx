My partner Beth and I love going on vacations to places that we've never been,
and this year we decided to go somewhere that would be totally new to both of us,
and that was Egypt for New Years, from December 28th to January 6th, just one
day shy of my birthday. We knew to expect the unexpected, but we weren't prepared
for how amazing the historical landmarks were, or how different the culture was.

We arrived in Cairo at night, close to midnight. The process for gaining
entrance to Egypt was a confusing and stressful one. First we had to wait in
line at a bank (the sole nearby ATM was out of cash), and then head over to
another line at another counter in order to get a Visa, and then finally wait
in line at customs for getting our passports stamped. Once all of that was done
we then had to face the crowds of taxis drivers standing at the entrance trying
to get a ride from us. Luckily the low-budget hotel in Giza that we booked had
arranged for someone to pick us up.

Right out of the gate (no pun intended) we were told by the driver that seat
belts are not required in Egypt, and sure enough there were none in the backseat.
Only the driver had one. He also said that there are "no rules" in Egypt. We
exchanged nervous glances but didn't know what else to do in terms of a ride
so we didn't voice any concerns. The driver gave us a verbal tour of the
different parts of Cairo and pointed out the "old city" and "new city". It was
obvious which was old and which was new. It also appears that lane markings on
the road are also not required to be followed, with cars driving all over the
place.

We arrived at the hotel in Giza, which was really just a single floor at the
top of a building, and entered through a muddy back alley. The room we had
booked with a pyramid view wasn't available, so they stuck us in a windowless
room. Things were not looking good so far.

## The Great Pyramids of Giza

The next morning we ate breakfast on the rooftop terrace, which did
have views of the pyramids, and they looked amazing. They still seemed so far
away but here we were staring at them in person. Afterwards we walked to the
Giza plateau since it was within less than a mile of where we were staying. The
route to get there was sketchy: we walked under highways, through construction
zones, and along local streets. The entrance to the plateau was hectic, with
lots of line-cutting (must be the norm in Egypt), but finally we emerged.

And there they were, the most infamous ancient wonders in the world: the Great
Pyramids of Giza. Pictures don't do it justice, these things were huge! Not only
that, but we were able to walk through the ruins of other structures around
the pyramids as well.

I love being able to walk up to, and touch, history. We were able to freely
explore the entire area, and see all of the pyramids of close and personal, from
all angles. We walked up to and around all three large pyramids, and then went
to the Sphinx. What an amazing experience this all is! Definitely a huge wow
factor. But the best part was coming up: going into the Great Pyramid itself.

The entrance into the Great Pyramid was from grave robbers who had tunneled in long,
long ago. Once we got through their tunnels, we finally entered the corridors
built by the ancient Egyptians. These corridors were very tight and cramped. I
can't imagine what it must have been like for the ancient workers who had to go
up and down these all day long. The Kings Chamber was our destination, and it
was just like the pictures from our history books: plain and empty. But that
doesn't matter, because we're standing inside of the great pyramid!

But now it was time to leave. We had seen it all, and now needed to make a
decision on where we were staying tonight.

## The Marriott

The hotel in Giza was a distaster, and we didn't feel safe staying there
another night. Nor did we need to. The only reason we had booked it was to have
a view of the pyramids at night while we explored Cairo during the day. But
given how far of a drive it was from Cairo to Giza, and the fact that our room
wasn't the one we had reserved, we decided to book a room in a Marriott in
downtown Cairo: it was a 5 star hotel in what used to be a royal palace.

We had a hard to time getting a refund from the Giza hotel owners, but eventually
they gave us a 75% refund (considering we had already stayed one night) in cash.
I felt nervous carrying so much money on me. Our Uber ride from Giza to the
new hotel was charotic: the driver got lost a couple of times, but we finally
made it.

This place was a dream! We should have booked this the first time around. It
was on an island, so it already felt nicer and safer, plus the surrounding
buildings and area were very upscale, or at least upscale compared to where we
just were. It had a guarded private entrance, and felt like a true and proper
hotel on the inside.

We got an executive room that came with private access to a lounge where food
and drinks were practically unlimited. We had most of our meals and daytime
snacks up there, along with all the wine we could handle. There was a brunch
area on the first floor, as well as an outdoor hookah area. It was amazing, and
worth the inflated New Years Eve price! Plus our room had a great view of Cairo
Tower where we were told the fireworks for NYE would be going off.

## Saqqarra and Memphis

The next day we booked a guided tour to Saqqarra where we visited the Bent, and
Stepped, pyramids up close. It was so cool to see the evolution of the pyramids,
and in the distance we could see the ruins of a handful of other pyramids that
just didn't work. Our guide also provided us with a good amount of background
knowledge about the history of these pyramids, and of ancient Egypt. We wish
we had this kind of experience at the Great Pyramids yesterday.

At the Stepped pyramid complex our guide got us free access to a tour of the
tombs and we saw our first heiroglyphics in person. It was a short tour, but
it was amazing nonetheless.

While our guide was informative about lots of things, we feel like we missed out
on seeing more, like going underneath the Stepped pyramid and exploring the
tunnels within. They said it wasn't that great so it was better to skip it. We
later assumed they were just doing the bare minimum in order to get their pay
day.

Afterwards our guide sort of kind of forced us to to a papyrus-making gift shop,
and the later to a perfume gift shop. We felt watched the entire time we were
there by the employees, who were practically begging for a sale. But it was neat
to see how papryus was made using the ancient technique.

We returned to our palace on the island and relaxed in the lounge and lower
hookah areas for the rest of the day.

## The Renowned Bazaar of Cairo, and The National Museum of Egyptian Civilization

The National Museum of Egyptian Civilization was huge when compared to the
previous one. It was also much more modern, with plenty of well-thought-out
space for everything. The exhibits were also arranged in chronological order
so that you could take a journey through Egyptian history from the time before
the Pharoahs and pyramids, to the modern age.

In the lower levels they had a nice dark area with a bunch of mummies from
various points of history of ancient Egypt. It was also very well maintained,
and respectful. They asked for silence on the way in, and everyone in there
actually respected the rules for a change.

After the museum we decided to take an Uber to an infamos Bazaar in Cairo, one
that had been in continuous operation for hundreds of years. The taxi/Uber ride
to the bazaar was hectic. The driver, for some reason, decided to drive through
the streets of the bazaar itself. We got so many angry looks from the locals.

The market itself was very crowded, and kind of confusing. We got lost a couple
of times, and were worried we wouldn't be able to make it out to the way we
had come in. There was also a lof of creepy looks from the shop owners, and no
one let us walk by in peace.

Needless to say, this was a bad experience, and not something I would recommend.

## The Egyptian Museum

Egypt was currently in the process of building a brand new museum on the Giza
plateau, but it wasn't ready yet when we where there, so we went to the "old"
museum of Egypt called The Egyptian Museum. They had said lots of things would be missing because they were
being moved to the new museum, but there was still tons to see. It was obvious
though that they needed a new and much larger museum becaue the current one
was stuffed to the brim with artifacts.

There were tons of coffins, statues both big and small, and funerary things to
see. But the coolest part was seeing Tuts coffin and burial mask. It was huge,
and so bright with all of that gold. Such an amazing sight.

We toured the rest of the museum for close to 2 hours before deciding we had had
enough and wanted to retire to our hotel and relax for the rest of the day,
enjoying that private lounge bonus. On the way out we each got souveniors from
the museum gift shop.

## Fireworks and NYE

Later that night was New Years Eve, and we had a very large meal at a restaurant
on the main level, and bought a series of small cakes to take back up to the
room with us. We set up camp on our balcony in order to watch the fireworks, and
as I said before we had a great view. They even lit up the tower with the
countdown. What a magical experience to be able to experience NYE in a foriegn
land.

## Luxor, Luxor Temple, and Karnak

<Gallery images={['2023/12/28/64f048a8-dd6b-4abb-90e4-46fc8237f623.jpeg','2023/12/28/5c4e717f-e226-44c7-b136-d058a1e96e9b.jpeg']} title="" />

On January 2nd we checked out of our luxury hotel and flew to Luxor. It was a
short flight, but it was better than taking the train or the bus. The city is a
much less crowded place than Cairo, and less hectic, but still the same behavior
from shop owners and locals, begging for money or harassing us to see if we
wanted to go on a camel ride.

The place we booked here was supposedly a 4 star hotel, but really it was a
3 star hotel. It was alongside the riverwalk near the Luxor Temple, and within
walking distanceo of Karnak, so it suited us well. But the bed was terribly
uncomfortable, and there was smoking everywhere inside the hotel. The only
restaurant in the joint had a terrible selection for dinner. But there was a
buffet-style breakfast and lunch on the second floor, and those weren't that bad!

The next day we checked out Luxor Temple, which was really cool to be standing
at the base of these humungous columns and satues. We spotted Greek writing
mixed in with ancient Egyptian which checks out with what the guide from the
other day told us about Alexandar the Greats conquering of Egypt and introduction
of the helenistic culture(s).

We then walked down the lonely Avenue of Sphinxes towards the Karnak temple
complex. No one else was on the avenue, so we had it all to ourselves, and we
much preferred walking along that then walking along the busy streets.

Luxor was amazing, but Karnak was huge! This temple complex was amazing. It was
big, tall, and the paintings on the walls were still in great condition. There
were so many things to see here. We spent a long time around around and checking
everything out.

After a long walk back to the hotel we decided to book a guided tour for the next
day to the Valley of the Kings, and Queens. We didn't dare try to go it alone
give how hectic the pyramids were.

## Valley of the Kings, Queens, and Habu Temple

<Gallery images={['2023/12/28/db9e500f-328c-4dca-b564-dfa15770748a.jpeg','2023/12/28/a0c09440-0ea8-4eda-83bd-121b3d31d61a.jpeg']} title="" />

This guide was a little better than our previous one, but still weird: he
admitted to marrying his cousins. Yes, plural. We stopped by the Colossi of
Memnon on the way to the valleys, and snapped some selfies. Cool to see, but
not overly wowing.

The Valley of the Kings was really cool, so many tombs to see. The guide got
us in, and helped pay for things by cutting the line, and then let us go do
our own thing once inside. We saw lots of cool tombs, including the tomb of
king Tut himself. These tomb chambers were so complex, and artfully decorated.

Queens Valley was less crowded so we got more time to walk around and see what
we wanted. There was only one tomb where you had to pay to enter, and we skipped it,
but the rest were still equally as amazing.

Habu Temple, the last one, takes the cake though. It was the most amazing
temple that I had seen on this trip, and it was in amazing condition. The
artworks and paintings were still pristine, and our guide got us amazing
behind-the-scenes access, and told us a ton of not-so-commonly known facts about
the place, and its historical purpose.

## A sunrise balloon ride over Luxor

<Gallery images={['2023/12/28/3b64df45-ea62-4f49-bce6-ca8f0a4349e4.jpeg']} title="" />

This was the highlight of our time in Egypt, and Luxor. On January 4th we were
picked up from our hotel at 4am, along with a bunch of others, and shuttled to
a balloon ride launching area. We waited in the cold dark early hours of the
morning for our time to fly.

The all-clear signl was given to the balloon ride companies, and their teams of
workers ran out to the balloons eager to be the first in the air. It was an
amazing sight watching these huge things go from the flames burning within them.

Our time came and we were shuffled into the basket of our balloon with the most
charistmatic captian one could hope for on an outing such as this. He gave us a
rundown of do's and dont's, and then we were off and ascending into the air.

The captian had a little jingle he kept singing: "Everything I do, I do for you."
It made us smile and laugh, and kept things cheery. The ride over the Valley of
the Kings and Queens below us was amazing. The sunrise, the views, it was the
perfect ending to this vacation.

## Returning to Cairo and leaving Egypt behind

It was time to return to Cairo for our flight home the next day. We stayed at a
different 5 star hotel, but this one wasn't as nice as the Marriott. But the
room did have great sunset views from the balcony.

We left at around 6:00 am the next day to begin our journey home, and we were
glad to leave.

Egypt is an amazing place if you only consider the historical things. The
way the locals treat foriegners leaves something to be desired. If we ever
came back we would definitely do it through a service that would plan
everything for us, and rely on tour guides for everything.

This trip though was unique, and probably a once-in-a-lifetime experience, and
we enjoyed a lot of it.
