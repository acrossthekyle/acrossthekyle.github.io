<Route />

I had known about this particular trek for a while (it was on those same lists
that recommended the Camino, TMB, Alta Via, etc.), but it never really peaked
my interest as it was a much shorter and less-rustic trek. But then COVID-19
showed up and after two years in lockdown and itching to get back out into the
world I decided to go on this shorter trek just to get back into the swing of
things.

This trek would end up being my least favorite out of them all. I was not
prepared for the amount of rain that would be dropped on me on nearly every day
of the trek, and by the end of it I was chilled to the bone and soaked
through-n-through. I was also hoping it would be a social route much like the
other hikes I had done, but it was not. Maybe it was because of COVID, or just
the nature of this short trek, but I was solo for the entire thing.

## What is the West Highland Way

The West Highland Way is a 96 mile trail in the highlands of Scotland, running
from Milngavie north of Glasgow to Fort William. The trail utilizes many ancient
roads, and old coaching routes. I walked from south to north, making it a
journey from the Lowlands to the Highlands. The route took me about 6 days to
complete while camping overnight in farms, along a lake, and under a bridge.

I went in May when the weather is supposedly favorable, and the nasty insects
known as Midges aren't out yet.

## Where I spent each night

Camping is the preferred form of accomodation on this trek, with wild camping
being a thing you can do in the UK, and I only took advantage of it one night.
I traded in the tent I had used on the "O" Circuit for a more traditional
backpacking tent (see gear list link above).

On the first night I chose to book a spot in a field in a farm, simply because
I didn't know how far I could go. The second night was spent on a reserved spot
on a beach, and the third night was back at a farm (a nearly flooded one at
that). The following day I took advantage of the wild camping and pitched my
tent next to an old stone bridge with some other people. On the second to last
night I chose to book a small cabin in a town.

## What I brought

I used the same gear as the "O" Circuit except with a different tent. What I
wish I had brought was more waterproof rain gear: pants, and shoes, mainly.

## Stages that I followed

Some places had to be booked in advance at the start due to government
regulations in the national park area around the Loc Lomond area, and due to me
not knowing how far I could go each day.

<Stages />

This trek would go down as the one of the worst ones I had done, even though I
did see some pretty amazing mountain scenery once I got high up in the
Highlands. But it also did teach me a lot of great lessons about prepping for an
unknown thru-hike, and to do better research on the weather.

It didn't scare me away from thru-hiking either, because one year later I would
be out there in the world again, this time in Corsica, France.
