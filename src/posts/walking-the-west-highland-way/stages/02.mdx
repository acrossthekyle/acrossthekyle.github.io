<Route />

No rain overnight, so that's a good sign for the day. My earplugs kept falling
out as I slept, making true deep sleep ellusive for the most part. I dressed in
my tent, packed up most of the gear, and exited to find a bright and cloudy
sky awaiting me.

Oatmeal with dehydrated banana slices is usually my go-to meal for backpacking
trips that I need to bring my own food, and this hike was no different. I set
about the task of boiling water on my tiny stove that was balanced on a piece
of rock so as to keep the flames away from the, albiet wet, grass. My companion
from yesterday emerged from their tent and started cooking breakfast as well.
They mentioned that they would be taking it slow today, and that yesterday was
rough on them, so I wished them a good hike and packed up my cooking gear after
finishing breakfast, and set out on the route.

We visited the town of Drymen last night, and today's route followed that same
way. Once past the town the route detoured from the road and onto a more
familiar dirt path that went between two farms. Green grass and yellow flowers
filled the space around me as the trail gradually merged with a local forest
preserve.

Luxurious wide gravel paths took me through pine woods, and sections of wood
that were bleached and/or regrowing from a previous disaster. Not more than
an hour later and the trail left the forest preserve behind, and once more
became a thin rock-strewn dirt path. The first views of the Loc were also
attainable from here, but the path did not go directly to them and instead it
curved to the right and towards hills and wide open lands.

Multiple stone walls separated the terrain into varoius misshapen grid chunks.
Gray clouds still hung overhead, threatening to start raining at any moment but
thankfully they never did. The mid-morning destination was becoming clearer
though as the trail was decidely heading in one direction: towards a massive
hill/mountain.

After a short bridge crossing over a meandering stream, the dirt path turned
into stone steps, which meant it was time to climb. Luckily the steps didn't
last for long before a dirt trail appeared and started to circle around and
zig-zag up the side of this monsterous hill. All around me were fields and
rolling hills patched up by strands of trees here and there.

Finally, after a turn in the trail, the Loc was in full view. Another 20 minutes
of walking and scrambling up some loose dirt/hillside terrain and I was at the
top. What a sight to behold! The gray clouds even gave way to white pillowy
clouds as I reached the top. This Loc was absolutely massive, and no wonder it
would take the rest of the day today, and most of the day tomorrow, before
finally getting around it. It must have been a weekend, or holiday, because the
trail was filled with a bunch of weekend hikers out for a stroll.

I knew I still had a ways to go today, so I spent just enough time up at the top
to get some photos, have a snack, and relax before beginning the descent straight
down to the local town below.

Going down wasn't that bad, it was the amount of people on the trail that made it
a not-fully-enjoyable time. But 30 minutes later and I was walking through
bright green confifer woods. It was nearly noon and time for lunch. I had only
brought enough meals for dinner and breakfast because I had read that there were
plenty of stops along the way to get lunch and/or snacks. I found a restaurant
on the edge of the water, and sat outside as I ate a burger and frees and sipped
on a nice cold beer.

Anxious to keep going I suited back up, refilled my water bottles, and set off
into the woods once more. The trail started ascending once more to get back into
the hills that surrounded that town. I passed by a few more WHW hikers as the
trail meandered through the trees before settling into a route that ran
parallel with the waters. The beaches that I passed were all very stony, and
no sand was present. After about 1.5 hours of walking at a brisk pace through
the hot and stuffy trees I was excited to finally come across the campground
where I would be spending the night.

My reserved spot was right on the beach, with a great view of the waters and
surrounding hills/mountains. It was 4pm at this point, which meant a lot of
time to just sit and chill. I strung up my dirty clothes to dry and air out,
set up the tent (which was no easy feat in the winds that were blowing off of
the lake), and sat in my backpacking chair. I read, took a nap, made some dinner,
strolled along the waters edge, and didn't do much of anything else before it
was time to go to bed.

Today was a good day on trail: amazing views, variety of terrain, and good
meals.
