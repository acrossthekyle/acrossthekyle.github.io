Thick gray clouds greeted me as I exited my tent in the morning. With a couple of
bars of cell signal, I opened up the weather app to see if any rain was due in
the near future. Sure enough, there it was: rain due in 30 minutes. I opted to
skip cooking breakfast, and just chowed down on some protein bars as I packed
up and hit the trail with my rain jacket on.

Sure enough, about 30-40 minutes later the first rain drops started to fall.
That's ok though, I thought, I've got a waterproof backpack and a good rain
jacket to keep me dry. Just as a precuation I had also put on my polyester
joggers (which were not waterproof) in order to provide some sort of rain
protection as I hiked. The shoes were another story, sure they would get wet but
they would also dry out quickly, if given the opportunity to do so.

The trail hugged the coastline of the Loc for the most part, mixed with multiple
detours into the surrounding green woods, but the waters were always somewhat
visible. The rain was really starting to come down now, and it was only 8am. I
passed an iconic red telephone booth in front of a bed and breakfast place. It
smelled like they were serving but I wasn't hungry and wasn't defeated by
the rain just yet.

Clouds started to cling to the sides of the hills surrounding the waters. While
most of the trail today was a dirt path, there were plenty of rocks strewn about
it. Some small, some large, but all of them in within my way of walking, and
all of them slippery from the rain. Good thing these Altra trail runners had
good grip!

I ran into a pair of mountain goats just chilling by the water under some trees,
waiting out the rain, unbothered. I dared not get too close because you never
know how a wild animal is going to react, and as soon as they caught sight of me
I decided that it was time to move on.

Small wooden bridges with railings crossed the more rugged areas of the trail,
especially over freshly flowing rivers and waterfalls. The area surrounding the
trail was full of bright green foliage, and colorful wildflowers. The trail
meandered through open clearings towards mornings end, removing what little
protection there was from the trees.

Moss-covered stones of old ruins popped up here and there along the way, but
there were no signs to indicate if they were of importance or not. Doesn't
matter to me, all historical/old things are cool-looking. I'd guess these
particular ones had been here for a while, given how much dirt and whatnot had
accumulated within.

About an hour later I came upon a massive waterfall that ran next to a hotel,
and luckily it was open for business. A welcomed respite from the ran, with
somewhere warm and dry where my things could dry off, hopefully. While they
were open for business, the kitchen was not, and all they had to offer was
water, juice, and coffee, plus some small pastries from the previous day. What
a let-down. My feet were thankful though for the rest and fresh pair of socks
though. I wasn't prepared for this much rain, and apparently (according to the
locals at the hotel) that this is the norm in Scotland. I should have done
better research. I rested for maybe an hour before continuing on.

The trail led away from the hotel road and back along the lake, through a
rocky and slippery mess. The designers of the trail must have thought people
would enjoy sliding, crouching, and hopping from rock to rock. Not much fun in
the rain though. I nearly slipped a handful of times, and had to go slow in
order to avoid slipping in more dangerous areas. Luckily these section didn't
last for too long before the trail was back to a flat path. However the flat
trail was now a river.

On and on I marched through the steady downpour of rain, wading through wet
and muddy trail conditions. At one point the water flowing over the trail
crested over the tops of my shoes, thoroughly soaking them through and through.
About an hour later I came to a free place to spend the night: a hut with beds,
fireplace, and lines to hang wet clothing. It was awfully cold in there, and I
seriously thought about staying since I was so wet and just wanted to dry out.
But as I sat there and contemplated going, the rain waters started to overflow
the threshold at the door, and were slowly flooding the floor of the place.
Needless to say, I opted to keep going, especially since there was no one else
there and I would have been cold and alone all night.

I pushed onwards towards Bienglas Farm, my original destination for the day.
By about 4 pm, or two hours since I left the hut, I arrived. I'm so glad I
didn't stay at that hut a while back. It's not really a farm, persay. Or at l
east, not today it isn't, but might have been at one point. This place had hot
showers, a restaurant serving hot meals, and a washing/drying machine for clothes!

Picking a spot for my tent was tricky, since most of the grounds were flooded,
or on a slope, but I found a spot under a broad tree with thick leaves. I asked
the person who had also set their tent up there if it was ok that I joined them,
and they said yes of course. I set up my tent, grabbed dry clothes,
and set off for the showers.

After a much need hot shower (of which I probably stayed in longer than I should
have and used up way to much hot water), I went to the restaurant to get some
hot food, and then off to the washing/drying machines for my laundry. With
nothing left to do, and a non-existent desire to hang out in my tent in the
cold wet air, I found a table in the restaruant and set up shop. A few other
hikers joined me, as space as limited, and we conversed for most of the
evening, and even split the laundry fee between us.

Given all that had happened today with being soaked from the rain, I had decided
to book a hotel for the next day. I usually don't give up this quickly, but
something about the weather and the loneliness of the trail made me want some
modern creature-comforts.

I turned in around 9pm, looking forward to the dry big warm bed of a hotel the
next day.
