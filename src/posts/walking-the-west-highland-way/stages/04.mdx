The morning brought a dryer outlook to the day than yesterdays did. While
dark gray clouds still hung around in the sky, there were more patches of blue
this morning than the day before. After a nice big traditional english breakfast
I grabbed my backpack and set off at a later-than-usual start time of 8:30 am.

Puddles littered the trail and made it quite the zig-zagging-game of avoiding
them. Once or twice I skimmed the tops of puddles while trying to hop between
them but I wasn't going to let that get me down. A slightly wet shoe toebox
is better than a fully soaked shoe.

Waterfalls and rivers were in full rage this morning after the deluge of rain.
It made some crossings a little sketchy by having to balance on top of large
rocks in the rivers waters, but overall it wasn't too bad. I soon left these
raging watery challenges behind as the trail ascended into dryer pastures.

Most of the morning was spent hiking through yellow grass fields and hills,
with the occasional ruins of a building popping up on either side of the trail.
Eager to put my good fortune with the weather to use, and being in happier
spirits thanks to fully dry/clean clothing and a full belly, I started to walk
at a brisk pace.

By 11 am I was up above the fields I had been walking through for the past 2.5
hours, and had wide views of the mountains and hills around me. The clouds on
the other hand were not being so cooperative and had thickened throughout the
morning and were now threatening rain once more. Luckily no rain was falling
yet, and instead of a fog was beginning to descend.

After walking above the fields for a short amount of time the trail took a turn
down and into some thinly-needled pine woods that slowly transitioned to some
confifer trees. There were lovely little streams running through it, and the
colors were really popping in here. It was a very pleasant walk through fog
and trees and whatnot. But this lovely experience ended about an hour after
entering the woods, because the exit from here was a massive section of
deforestation. What a terrible thing to have on a national scenic trail.

Over and under stone bridges, through more short stretches of woods, until I was
once again walking through wide-open fields of green flanked by mountains on
either side. Truly a beautiful site, even with the heavy clouds.

By 12:30 pm I had reached the place I was originally planning to stay at, but
becuase I was in such good spirits and the clouds were slowly going away, I
decided to keep going and head for a popular spot, and the place I was going to
go to the following day: the town called Bridge of Orchy. At 1:30 pm I came to
a large town and grabbed some lunch at a restaurant. An hour later and I was off.

Bright sunshine was now in abundance as I took the trail out of town and back
into the mountains. Massive and impressive formations of mountains and hills
dominated the views around me. The trail after the town was really wide, and
practically level for the entire rest of the day. Needless to say, at my brisk
pace I was making great time and covering a lot of distance.

I walked into Bridge of Orchy around 4:30 pm, tired and exhausted after such a
long day of walking. The spot for camping in this town was along the river that
ran alongside it, next to the bridge the town is named after. The only buildings
in this town were a church and an inn that you could stay at, but I opted for
camping. It took a little while to find a level spot to set up, but eventually
I found something. There were also a good amount of other people camping here
as well. And there was a proper bathroom since a lot of people were also parking
their RV's here. I snapped some photos of the bridge, and the surrounding
countryside, made some dinner, and let my feet recover while sitting at a park
table in the small camping area with some other hikers.

Rain started to fall around 7pm, which meant it was time to retreat and get
inside of the tent. Only two more days left now, and today was a great day.
