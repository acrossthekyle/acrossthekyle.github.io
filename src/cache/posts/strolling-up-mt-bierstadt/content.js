This was another class 1 route, with a\nlot of scrambling over boulders near the summit, but nothing too crazy. The most\nunique thing about this 14'er was the massive and paved parking lot, which was\nalready overflowing by the time I showed up at 6am.\n\nThe trail was very crowded already, but that's what you get for choosing a peak\nthat is really close to a major city and has a paved road all the way to the\nparking lot. Makes it an easy day-hike for the locals.\n\n<Gallery images={['2020/09/05/f91239d1-54c4-4dc8-b078-53fe0c347d1f.jpeg']} title=\"Lovely flat part at the start of the trail\" />\n\nIt was a nice flat trail for the first hour or so, through prairies filled\nwith bushes, along small lakes and streams. There was even a board walk for\nthe first little bit so that you wouldn't disturb the local vegetation, and\nto make it easier to cross the many streams. I really enjoyed the start to this\ntrail, it was very idyllic and I took lots of photos of it.\n\nOnce the trail reached the base of the mountain, it turned into switchbacks all\nthe way to the boulders near the top. The total elevation gain was somewhere in\nthe 2,000's, and by 10:30 am I was already at the top. Wow, such an easy climb!\n\n<Gallery images={['2020/09/05/e46a56a1-0cdc-4eec-ae41-9ae80f5d100a.jpeg','2020/09/05/41cff62a-9962-46bc-bb6d-2dfe9d281e51.jpeg']} title=\"A lovely afternoon on Mt. Bierstadt\" />\n\nI made some friends at the top, but the peak started to get crowded fast as more\nand more people showed up, so I didn't stay long. There was some minor scrambling\non the way down, and wayfinding was a little rough but I generally follow other\npeople in this situation. It was an easy and fast descent back to the car, and\na good thing too because it was starting to get really hot out.\n\nI really enjoyed this hike, and the area. The Colorado plains and skies, the colors\nare just amazing.\n\n";
