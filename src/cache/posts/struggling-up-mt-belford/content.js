Belford, a peak with 4,500 feet of gain over a\ndistance of four miles. Quite a bit of gain over a relatively short distance,\nand it would end up kicking my butt. I think I struggled the most on this peak,\nout of all the peaks I've done solo, including my first one of Mt. Elbert.\n\nThere was plenty of space in the parking lot when I arrived at 6am, and there\nwould maybe be three other people on the trail in the morning, but more would\nstart to arrive later on, and I would run into them on the way down.\n\nThe trail started off very steep, but that makes sense due to the short distance\nand large gain: roughly 1,000 feet per mile. I had to stop a lot early on in\norder to catch my breath. It continued like this for maybe an hour or so as I\nmade my way through the thick forests.\n\n<Gallery images={['2022/09/09/43cbd3f9-8d70-49d8-9b95-d48c69c5198f.jpeg']} title=\"Hiking in the suns shadow\" />\n\nA few random stream crossings here and there, each with a bridge made up of\nfallen tree trunks laid across them. There were some grassy clearings mixed in\namongst the trees, allowing for some breathing room and the chance to actually\nget a look ahead on the trail. Eventually the thick forests gave way to small\nconifer trees, and more open spaces. On the way there are the ruins of an old\ncabin, and I love exploring old abandoned things.\n\nAfter two and a half hours I was above the treeline, but still in the shade of\nthe mountains around me while walking through the valley between them due to\ntheir steep sides. By now though I can see far ahead on the trail, with some\nlovely views all around me. And by now the path wasn't that bad actually: it was\nmostly flat for a good long while.\n\nMaybe an hour later and it was time to start ascending the sides of the valley\nand begin gaining on the mountain itself. The sun was slowly approaching over\nthe top of the mountains. An hour later, and now four hours into the hike, and\nI am finlly high enough up to see other peaks around me. The skies are a nice\ndeep blue with small white clouds.\n\n<Gallery images={['2022/09/09/7263c5d2-cf07-495e-ae75-19e41c737cd3.jpeg','2022/09/09/96a0b2b7-066f-4b1d-bc85-7737f96622f4.jpeg']} title=\"A mountain lake and other peaks\" />\n\nFive hours in and I am now up on the ridge between mountain peaks, with the\ntrail to the summit in sight! 45 minutes later and I am at the summit. There's\na couple of other people there who were coming/going and continuing along the\ntrail since it's part of a combo route. I opted for just the single peak this\ntime.\n\nIt was windy and chilly at the top, as it usually is in this area. I\nfound the elevation marker left by the USGS, and snapped some photos of my\naccomplishment. Boy was I tired, but I knew I had a long way to go on my way\nback down, and there were dark clouds starting to form in the distance.\n\nSpeaking of being tired, I slipped on some lose scree right as I started to\nmake my way down, and had some nice cuts and scrapes, but nothing a bandaid and\nhand sanitizer couldn't handle. I brushed myself off and pushed on.\n\nI didn't take any photos on the way down. I was too eager to get back to the car,\nand away from any possible afternoon storms. There were some other people coming\nup as I went down, but for the most part I was alone, which is nice sometimes.\nI finally made it back to the car three and a half hours later.\n\nWhat a rough peak to do on day one!\n\n";
