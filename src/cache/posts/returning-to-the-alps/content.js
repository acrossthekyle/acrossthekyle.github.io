In July of 2024 I made that a reality, and this time I wasn't going alone: my partner joined me on this classic European trek in order to introduce them to the hut-to-hut backpacking lifestyle.\n\n<Stats />\n\n<Route />\n\nWe were treated with great weather on this trek with a couple days of rain later \nin the evening (well after we had arrived at our places of stay for the day), \nand only one day of light drizzle on us as we crossed from Italy into Switzerland.\n\nOverall the trek was much like I remembered it, and it was a nice trip down \nmemory lane as we walked along the trail. It was a bit of a struggle in some \nparts due to us living in the flat lands of Chicago, but we managed to conquer \neach tough segment and relax at the end of the day with a couple of beverages. \n\nYou can read about my 2018 experience of the TMB [here](/posts/the-tour-du-mont-blanc). \n\n<Gallery images={['2024/07/27/58-9F8F6C5A-FF9F-4682-853C-2430D113E16A.jpeg']} title=\"Atop the Aiguillette des Posettes in France\" />\n\n## Stages that we followed\n\nWe followed the same route as 2018, and stayed at nearly all of the same \nplaces. The only differences were La Fouly and Trient, where we stayed at \nHotel Edelweiss and Hotel Forclaz, respectively.\n\n<Stages />\n";
