This\none was advertised as being not as long or as rough as Mt. Elbert, but knowing that\nI could do the biggest and baddest of the easier 14'ers made me feel more\nconfident about this one, but we shall see...\n\nI parked on the road after driving for two and half hours and listening to that\n80's retro station. The trailhead started right from the edge of the road, so\nthere was no official parking lot for this one. It was 4:30 am in the morning.\n\nMost of the trail in the woods was switchbacks, and a lot of the portions had\nstairs carved out of the rock. This made it somewhat easy to manage but that\nstill meant doing a lot of stair climbing, especially after being sore and tired\nfrom yesterdays hike.\n\nThere was a good amount of people on the trail this morning, and evenly spaced\nso that I was still hiking solo but could still the light from their headlamps.\n\nBy 6:00 am I was above the trees, and just in time. There was a beautiful\nsunrise and I am glad I got started as early as I did in order to be able to\nwitness it.\n\n<Gallery images={['2019/09/01/7a2764e8-05b2-4acd-94f4-a82490613626.jpeg']} title=\"Sunrise\" />\n\nTons of large cairns marked the trail and I always love a good cairn; it makes\nfor a good element in a photo. Most of the trail from the trailhead to just\nbelow the summit was rock-cut stairs, with the same amount of rise between steps\nas a staircase in a home would be, which actually ended up being pretty nice\nand made the ascent predictable in terms of pace.\n\nI saw a lot of cute little critters that looked like tiny squirrels called\nPikas. They were chirping to eachother as they scurried over and under\nrocks looking for food.\n\nAt long last I could see the summit, and the singular flase summit in front of it.\nOnce on the ridge ot the summit the trail transitioned from stairs to scree-filled\npaths. There were still some snow patches here and there on the sides of the\ntrail. I made the summit by 8:00 am! Such a faster time than Mt. Elbert by nearly\ntwo hours.\n\n<Gallery images={['2019/09/01/b2a03d11-3431-4987-a242-8f17afd16c2a.jpeg']} title=\"The summit is within reach\" />\n\nAs I stood there taking in the view and snapping photos of the surrounding area\npeople asked if I could take their picture for them, which was a good icebreaker!\nI ended up chatting with a bunch of people, and was even offered a free beer. I\nspent a good 30-45 minutes up there, and even had cell reception. Soon it would\nbe time to start heading back down though.\n\nMe and one other person left at the same time, and they helped set a good pace\nwhile going down. At one point they were practically flying over the rocks, and\nI matched their style. It ended up being surprisingly easy given how well the\ntrail itself was maintained. I was worried about my knees, but the braces did\ntheir job. By 1:00 pm I was back down at the car.\n\nThis was such an amazing experience with an easy hike up, a great group of fun\nand social people, and of course a free beer. It really helped to salvage the\nwhole trip and turn it into a really positive experience. I would most\ndefinitely be coming back for more next year.\n\n";
