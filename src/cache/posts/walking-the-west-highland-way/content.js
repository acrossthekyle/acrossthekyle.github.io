export const content = "\n<Stats />\n\n<Route />\n\nI had known about this particular trek for a while (it was on those same lists\nthat recommended the Camino, TMB, Alta Via, etc.), but it never really peaked\nmy interest as it was a much shorter and less-rustic trek. But then COVID-19\nshowed up and after two years in lockdown and itching to get back out into the\nworld I decided to go on this shorter trek just to get back into the swing of\nthings.\n\nThis trek would end up being my least favorite out of them all. I was not\nprepared for the amount of rain that would be dropped on me on nearly every day\nof the trek, and by the end of it I was chilled to the bone and soaked\nthrough-n-through. I was also hoping it would be a social route much like the\nother hikes I had done, but it was not. Maybe it was because of COVID, or just\nthe nature of this short trek, but I was solo for the entire thing.\n\n## What is the West Highland Way\n\nThe West Highland Way is a 96 mile trail in the highlands of Scotland, running\nfrom Milngavie north of Glasgow to Fort William. The trail utilizes many ancient\nroads, and old coaching routes. I walked from south to north, making it a\njourney from the Lowlands to the Highlands. The route took me about 6 days to\ncomplete while camping overnight in farms, along a lake, and under a bridge.\n\nI went in May when the weather is supposedly favorable, and the nasty insects\nknown as Midges aren't out yet.\n\n<World\n  markers={[\n    {\n      left: '43.6%',\n      top: '13.4%',\n    },\n  ]}\n/>\n\n## Where I spent each night\n\nCamping is the preferred form of accomodation on this trek, with wild camping\nbeing a thing you can do in the UK, and I only took advantage of it one night.\nI traded in the tent I had used on the \"O\" Circuit for a more traditional\nbackpacking tent (see gear list link above).\n\nOn the first night I chose to book a spot in a field in a farm, simply because\nI didn't know how far I could go. The second night was spent on a reserved spot\non a beach, and the third night was back at a farm (a nearly flooded one at\nthat). The following day I took advantage of the wild camping and pitched my\ntent next to an old stone bridge with some other people. On the second to last\nnight I chose to book a small cabin in a town.\n\n## What I brought\n\nI used the same gear as the \"O\" Circuit except with a different tent. What I\nwish I had brought was more waterproof rain gear: pants, and shoes, mainly.\n\n## Stages that I followed\n\nSome places had to be booked in advance at the start due to government\nregulations in the national park area around the Loc Lomond area, and due to me\nnot knowing how far I could go each day.\n\n<Stages />\n\nThis trek would go down as the one of the worst ones I had done, even though I\ndid see some pretty amazing mountain scenery once I got high up in the\nHighlands. But it also did teach me a lot of great lessons about prepping for an\nunknown thru-hike, and to do better research on the weather.\n\nIt didn't scare me away from thru-hiking either, because one year later I would\nbe out there in the world again, this time in Corsica, France.\n\n";
