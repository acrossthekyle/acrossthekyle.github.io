I dressed in\nmy tent, packed up most of the gear, and exited to find a bright and cloudy\nsky awaiting me.\n\nOatmeal with dehydrated banana slices is usually my go-to meal for backpacking\ntrips that I need to bring my own food, and this hike was no different. I set\nabout the task of boiling water on my tiny stove that was balanced on a piece\nof rock so as to keep the flames away from the, albiet wet, grass. My companion\nfrom yesterday emerged from their tent and started cooking breakfast as well.\nThey mentioned that they would be taking it slow today, and that yesterday was\nrough on them, so I wished them a good hike and packed up my cooking gear after\nfinishing breakfast, and set out on the route.\n\n<Gallery images={['2022/05/07/9f2d98c6-4adc-413b-8ca8-660191d69795.jpeg','2022/05/07/df36352e-2cff-4521-a7ea-77c0e2cc75af.jpeg','2022/05/07/3f3feed7-6c79-478a-b748-2bc544122292.jpeg']} title=\"Green fields and yellow flowers\" />\n\nWe visited the town of Drymen last night, and today's route followed that same\nway. Once past the town the route detoured from the road and onto a more\nfamiliar dirt path that went between two farms. Green grass and yellow flowers\nfilled the space around me as the trail gradually merged with a local forest\npreserve.\n\nLuxurious wide gravel paths took me through pine woods, and sections of wood\nthat were bleached and/or regrowing from a previous disaster. Not more than\nan hour later and the trail left the forest preserve behind, and once more\nbecame a thin rock-strewn dirt path. The first views of the Loc were also\nattainable from here, but the path did not go directly to them and instead it\ncurved to the right and towards hills and wide open lands.\n\n<Gallery images={['2022/05/07/63be9988-0ad4-4b6c-bb16-03c88ec479f3.jpeg','2022/05/07/56541064-4d27-47fe-8843-5871069d28af.jpeg','2022/05/07/5c7b38f8-f093-4434-9940-c53c27c44070.jpeg']} title=\"Forest preserve\" />\n\nMultiple stone walls separated the terrain into varoius misshapen grid chunks.\nGray clouds still hung overhead, threatening to start raining at any moment but\nthankfully they never did. The mid-morning destination was becoming clearer\nthough as the trail was decidely heading in one direction: towards a massive\nhill/mountain.\n\nAfter a short bridge crossing over a meandering stream, the dirt path turned\ninto stone steps, which meant it was time to climb. Luckily the steps didn't\nlast for long before a dirt trail appeared and started to circle around and\nzig-zag up the side of this monsterous hill. All around me were fields and\nrolling hills patched up by strands of trees here and there.\n\n<Gallery images={['2022/05/07/857298c7-c7a0-4fe1-8afb-b2be7debbe4c.jpeg','2022/05/07/2fe23489-388d-4de8-ac93-7ddfa8cbfe6c.jpeg','2022/05/07/4c550a9d-7aa6-49f9-abcc-8017577d291a.jpeg']} title=\"Walking through hills\" />\n\nFinally, after a turn in the trail, the Loc was in full view. Another 20 minutes\nof walking and scrambling up some loose dirt/hillside terrain and I was at the\ntop. What a sight to behold! The gray clouds even gave way to white pillowy\nclouds as I reached the top. This Loc was absolutely massive, and no wonder it\nwould take the rest of the day today, and most of the day tomorrow, before\nfinally getting around it. It must have been a weekend, or holiday, because the\ntrail was filled with a bunch of weekend hikers out for a stroll.\n\nI knew I still had a ways to go today, so I spent just enough time up at the top\nto get some photos, have a snack, and relax before beginning the descent straight\ndown to the local town below.\n\n<Gallery images={['2022/05/07/592a4e93-e26d-4226-9792-8f0f3380bc01.jpeg','2022/05/07/746b43bc-8125-42c2-a9e7-6e1805a1ada5.jpeg']} title=\"Views of Loc Lomond from atop the hill\" />\n\nGoing down wasn't that bad, it was the amount of people on the trail that made it\na not-fully-enjoyable time. But 30 minutes later and I was walking through\nbright green confifer woods. It was nearly noon and time for lunch. I had only\nbrought enough meals for dinner and breakfast because I had read that there were\nplenty of stops along the way to get lunch and/or snacks. I found a restaurant\non the edge of the water, and sat outside as I ate a burger and frees and sipped\non a nice cold beer.\n\nAnxious to keep going I suited back up, refilled my water bottles, and set off\ninto the woods once more. The trail started ascending once more to get back into\nthe hills that surrounded that town. I passed by a few more WHW hikers as the\ntrail meandered through the trees before settling into a route that ran\nparallel with the waters. The beaches that I passed were all very stony, and\nno sand was present. After about 1.5 hours of walking at a brisk pace through\nthe hot and stuffy trees I was excited to finally come across the campground\nwhere I would be spending the night.\n\n<Gallery images={['2022/05/07/807b1583-65ed-4949-befa-9d43f1eff189.jpeg','2022/05/07/af68be7e-6369-492f-a0cb-91805769feaa.jpeg','2022/05/07/a2ef1938-d92e-46e0-8b77-5be05d2ee1de.jpeg']} title=\"Camping along a beach\" />\n\nMy reserved spot was right on the beach, with a great view of the waters and\nsurrounding hills/mountains. It was 4pm at this point, which meant a lot of\ntime to just sit and chill. I strung up my dirty clothes to dry and air out,\nset up the tent (which was no easy feat in the winds that were blowing off of\nthe lake), and sat in my backpacking chair. I read, took a nap, made some dinner,\nstrolled along the waters edge, and didn't do much of anything else before it\nwas time to go to bed.\n\nToday was a good day on trail: amazing views, variety of terrain, and good\nmeals.\n\n";
