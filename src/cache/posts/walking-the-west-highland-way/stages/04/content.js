While\ndark gray clouds still hung around in the sky, there were more patches of blue\nthis morning than the day before. After a nice big traditional english breakfast\nI grabbed my backpack and set off at a later-than-usual start time of 8:30 am.\n\nPuddles littered the trail and made it quite the zig-zagging-game of avoiding\nthem. Once or twice I skimmed the tops of puddles while trying to hop between\nthem but I wasn't going to let that get me down. A slightly wet shoe toebox\nis better than a fully soaked shoe.\n\n<Gallery images={['2022/05/07/da01a740-2f95-495b-a077-98dc6c03dd34.jpeg','2022/05/07/0533d027-1f08-47e6-9843-57e8e4acb803.jpeg']} title=\"Raging rivers in the morning\" />\n\nWaterfalls and rivers were in full rage this morning after the deluge of rain.\nIt made some crossings a little sketchy by having to balance on top of large\nrocks in the rivers waters, but overall it wasn't too bad. I soon left these\nraging watery challenges behind as the trail ascended into dryer pastures.\n\nMost of the morning was spent hiking through yellow grass fields and hills,\nwith the occasional ruins of a building popping up on either side of the trail.\nEager to put my good fortune with the weather to use, and being in happier\nspirits thanks to fully dry/clean clothing and a full belly, I started to walk\nat a brisk pace.\n\n<Gallery images={['2022/05/07/0de70011-084b-4852-a620-748032f60acf.jpeg','2022/05/07/22003963-71ee-4357-bd85-56af1acdc691.jpeg']} title=\"Up into the hills\" />\n\nBy 11 am I was up above the fields I had been walking through for the past 2.5\nhours, and had wide views of the mountains and hills around me. The clouds on\nthe other hand were not being so cooperative and had thickened throughout the\nmorning and were now threatening rain once more. Luckily no rain was falling\nyet, and instead of a fog was beginning to descend.\n\nAfter walking above the fields for a short amount of time the trail took a turn\ndown and into some thinly-needled pine woods that slowly transitioned to some\nconfifer trees. There were lovely little streams running through it, and the\ncolors were really popping in here. It was a very pleasant walk through fog\nand trees and whatnot. But this lovely experience ended about an hour after\nentering the woods, because the exit from here was a massive section of\ndeforestation. What a terrible thing to have on a national scenic trail.\n\n<Gallery images={['2022/05/07/b5435e14-2a11-46e6-b07c-fc378021eb08.jpeg','2022/05/07/47be52f4-873a-4125-b27d-ca9b200485b7.jpeg','2022/05/07/f842df6b-86d9-45df-b7b2-4be58fb474d3.jpeg']} title=\"Walking through the woods\" />\n\nOver and under stone bridges, through more short stretches of woods, until I was\nonce again walking through wide-open fields of green flanked by mountains on\neither side. Truly a beautiful site, even with the heavy clouds.\n\nBy 12:30 pm I had reached the place I was originally planning to stay at, but\nbecuase I was in such good spirits and the clouds were slowly going away, I\ndecided to keep going and head for a popular spot, and the place I was going to\ngo to the following day: the town called Bridge of Orchy. At 1:30 pm I came to\na large town and grabbed some lunch at a restaurant. An hour later and I was off.\n\nBright sunshine was now in abundance as I took the trail out of town and back\ninto the mountains. Massive and impressive formations of mountains and hills\ndominated the views around me. The trail after the town was really wide, and\npractically level for the entire rest of the day. Needless to say, at my brisk\npace I was making great time and covering a lot of distance.\n\n<Gallery images={['2022/05/07/68af005a-0b52-431f-be69-47212eceb8f4.jpeg','2022/05/07/efe89a62-7fb7-4015-8f31-9516950fd7e5.jpeg']} title=\"A mostly flat trail through mountains and hills\" />\n\nI walked into Bridge of Orchy around 4:30 pm, tired and exhausted after such a\nlong day of walking. The spot for camping in this town was along the river that\nran alongside it, next to the bridge the town is named after. The only buildings\nin this town were a church and an inn that you could stay at, but I opted for\ncamping. It took a little while to find a level spot to set up, but eventually\nI found something. There were also a good amount of other people camping here\nas well. And there was a proper bathroom since a lot of people were also parking\ntheir RV's here. I snapped some photos of the bridge, and the surrounding\ncountryside, made some dinner, and let my feet recover while sitting at a park\ntable in the small camping area with some other hikers.\n\n<Gallery images={['2022/05/07/24f75d87-aebe-4c87-968c-444c87aeb177.jpeg']} title=\"Bridge of Orchy\" />\n\nRain started to fall around 7pm, which meant it was time to retreat and get\ninside of the tent. Only two more days left now, and today was a great day.\n\n";
