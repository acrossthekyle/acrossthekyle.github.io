And this\nthru-hike had all of those. I left my hotel at 7am on an empty stomach, unsure\nof what to expect from this adventure.\n\nFirst things first, I had to get breakfast before I caught a train from Glasgow\nto the starting point: Drymen. Luckily there was a familiar place to get some\nfood: McDonalds. I ordered a basic breakfast menu item, and snarfed it down as\nI quickly walked to the station. You don't want to be late on your first day!\n\nThe station was easy enough to find, however the exact gate was a bit harder\nto sus out. Good thing I was in a country that used my native tongue (or at\nleast as close to it as Scottish is to American English). The platform wasn't on\nthe main level, but a sub-level seeing as it was a more local train and not one\nbound for, example, London. Good thing I wasn't the only one heading that way.\n\nI didn't have to wait long for the train to arrive. Right on schedule. I felt\nuneasy stowing my backpack in one of the luggage shelves, so I kept it on my lap.\nThere were some people on the train that I had seen yesterday as I toured the\ncity, and others that I had spotted in the station this morning. One of those\npeople sat across from me. I couldn't think of a non-awkward way of\nstriking up a conversation, and considering I was pretty confident about what\nthey would say seeing as they had a very large backpack with them, I said\n\"I hope this is the right train to Drymen for the West Highland Way.\" And that's\nall it took: we became instant trail-friends on the train, and hiked that first\nday together. By the second day though, I was on my own for the rest of the hike.\n\n<Gallery images={['2022/05/07/2f3b55a9-5d2d-4070-a380-3f962c6934d8.jpeg']} title=\"Walking through city parks on our way out of Drymen\" />\n\nA short train ride later and we were in Drymen. Our first priority was finding\nfood for breakfast since I only had a small sandwhich from McDonalds, and they\nhad nothing. We stood out as we went in the opposite direction of the trail\nstarting point and went to a local grocery store. With food in hand we returned\nto the start point.\n\nYou can judge how much a place cares about a trail by it's starting point. Is it\nceremonious, or is it just a sign on a dirt trail? The West Highland Way (WHW)\nhad a proper marker for the start of the trail in the form of a small obelisk,\nand an archway with the name of the trail in big bold letters on a metal banner\nacross it. We posed for selfies before strapping in, grabbing our poles, and\nheading through the arch and onto the trail.\n\nFor the first hour or so we walked through the outskirts of the town by going\nthrough a lands set aside as a city park or walking path area. By 10 am we were\nwell out of the city and into open farm fields and pastures.\n\n<Gallery images={['2022/05/07/d8992213-253a-4ae3-887a-edf8e8a6f489.jpeg']} title=\"Small stone walls dotted the trail\" />\n\nLots of short stone walls and wooden fences surrounded us as we walked along a\ngravel path. The trail was bisected by a road for a short while, and walking\nalong a road is never a fun time. Luckily it didn't take long and we were back\nonto grassy terrain in no time. We passed through a metal gate, and were in\nthe lowlands. There were green hills as far as the eye could see.\n\nHere and there trail markers dotted the path, emblazened with the WHW symbol.\nClouds threatened to drop rain on us all day, but thankfully they never did.\nWe marched through green fields, across rivers, and through thickets of trees.\n\n<Gallery images={['2022/05/07/99ae4cfd-2a1d-40fe-bc8c-71ac9b4125e6.jpeg']} title=\"Hills everywhere\" />\n\nAround noon we came to our first resting spot of the day, a trail-side cafe\ncalled \"Turnip the Beet\". Clever. I ordered one of the most delicious trail\nsandwiches I had had in a long time. I gobbled the whole thing down in no time\nat all. Thirty minutes later and we were back on the trail, just before a light\nmisting of rain began. We donned our rain coats and kept going.\n\nMore green pastures and fields as the afternoon got on. The misty rain went away\nshortly after we continued walking, and sunny skies were with us for the rest\nof the day. Cows and sheep and ducks kept us company on both sides of the trail\nbehind small wooden fences. We even passed a \"Trolls Bridge\" at one point. It\nwas fenced off, but who knows if it was real or not.\n\n<Gallery images={['2022/05/07/6e0cdfe6-a4d4-4acf-8990-e067ec56f51b.jpeg','2022/05/07/14b12595-9056-4f84-9acf-fb22646190b3.jpeg']} title=\"Cows and sheep keeping us company\" />\n\nThe dirt trail gradually turned into walking on a road once more, albiet a much\nmore local and farm-type road (no lane markers, only wide enough for one car), so\nthere wasn't much traffic. This road walking would continue until we made it to\nthe first place for the night: a field on a farm in the town of Drymen, Scotland.\n\nBy 3pm we had arrived. I set up my tent and got my home-on-the-go situated. This\nplace had hot showers, a welcomed relief at the end of a long day of walking. I\nhad a CLIF protein bar for a snack, and then sat there for a bit in front of\nmy tent. Dinner time roled around, and it was time to fire up the trekking stove.\nI can't recall what the meal was, but it was a pre-made backpacking meal.\n\nAfter eating the person who I had walked with today asked if I wanted to go\ninto the nearby town and grab a drink. Sure, why not. What else have I got to\ndo here in a field on a farm? It took about 20 minutes to get to there, but\nthere wasn't much...there. A small hotel with a restaurant and a bar/cafe that\nlooked just a little too fancy for us. We opted for a pint at the hotel bar. It\nwasn't very glamorous, but at least it was something to do.\n\nWe headed back to the farm after only one drink each, and settled in for the\nnight. Tomorrow I would be heading to a campsite on the beaches of Loc Lomond,\nand if the sunny weather held it would promise to be an awesome experience.\n\n";
