I had a cabin reserved for\nthe night in the town of Kinlochleven, and would desperately need it after\nanother rain-soaked day.\n\nA rivers rushing waters, a kind of whitenoise, always help me sleep. Breakfast\ntoday would be two packets of granola and two packets of dried banana slices. I\nhad a surplus of backpacking food at this point, and would be able to leave the\nrest of it behind at the cabin tonight since tomorrow would be my last day on\ntrail. The clock struck 8am, and I was on my way.\n\n<Gallery images={['2022/05/07/83ba597e-3934-4a9d-9386-bcb4f893433c.jpeg','2022/05/07/8d203898-30f1-4f59-ae81-55141fcc11b6.jpeg']} title=\"Forests to start the day\" />\n\nForests lined the riverbank where I slept last night, and it was nice to be\nwalking within them right out of the gate. Rains last night created fresh wet\nconditions on the trail though, which meant more tiptoeing on any rocks that\nstuck their tops above water. My shoes did stay dry for long sadly.\n\nNot 30 minutes later and forests were already behind me, and scraggly grasslands\nlay before me, with a large lake in the distance. Up and over hills, dry patches\nof trail few and far between. Discontinous forests in oddly arranged groups\nwere in the distance all around me, perhaps a reforesting process? Up ahead\nthere was a bed and breakfast, but the restaurant services were only for guests\nand the store for buying snacks wasn't open yet. I waited a little bit to see\nif someone would come and open up shop, but they never did. Given how far I\nwould have to go today I decided to simply bust out a protein bar and keep going.\n\n<Gallery images={['2022/05/07/6a30f7fb-48fd-4084-acec-4c2700279d5a.jpeg','2022/05/07/c0cdbb20-4a7b-4be6-a8c4-f2c95d6804cf.jpeg','2022/05/07/cc732fcd-b811-4090-afda-552bdcf66caf.jpeg']} title=\"No more forests, hello scraggly grasses\" />\n\nThe terrain today varied between forests, and grasslands, and the trail\nseemed to stretch on forever into the distant mountains. By this point, around\n10am, the clouds started to drop their rain on me. It started as a fine mist,\nbut slowly turned into a steady downpour of rain. I did not see many people on\ntoday's segment, maybe the rain kept them away.\n\nBesides the rain, the views on this part of the trail today were amazing! I\nlove hiking in the mountains, and today I was surrounded by all sorts of them.\nI truly felt like I was alone in the world today, walking through this remote\nland, with the unrelenting rain beating down on me, and not another soul in\nsight.\n\n<Gallery images={['2022/05/07/2aecc0c3-092b-412f-abbc-9697f63963f0.jpeg','2022/05/07/a3a1a713-a94f-4dc8-bd95-affb163635ac.jpeg','2022/05/07/97b4d6f3-d82a-4188-abf4-ddd57582614c.jpeg']} title=\"Walking alone in varied terrain today\" />\n\nFor nearly two hours I marched on through the rain, up and over small passes\nbetween mountains, trying to stay in good spirits. Eventually the trail left\nthe remote world behind and joined up with a paved road that led to a hotel\ncalled The Kingshouse. It's one of the stops along the way, and I hoped they\nwould have hot food, and sure enough, they did.\n\nI spent a good long hour there, eating hot food, and trying to let my stuff dry\nout as much as possible. I used one of the bathroom stales to change out of my\nwet clothing, and into some fresh dry things. There's nothing like a dry pair of\nsocks and underwear to immediately brighten ones spirits. At 1pm I left The\nKingshouse behind and continued on me way, through more mountains.\n\nThe rain was done for the day, thank god, and the sunshine brought the most\namazing views I had seen so far. A bright blue sky, and dark stone mountains,\ndominated my view, and the world around me. These pictures don't do it justice.\n\n<Gallery images={['2022/05/07/89bfbd46-67a1-45c6-bd6d-2556022bdbb7.jpeg','2022/05/07/e5cf5fd0-41e5-46c1-8b05-6149a8fc8205.jpeg']} title=\"Amazing mountains in the highlands\" />\n\nAfter walking through these amazing mountains for another 90 minutes, it was time\nto start descending down into the town of Kinlochleven. It was a long way down,\ntook nearly an hour but felt like forever what with all of the twist and turns\nin the trail. Eventually I reached the towns outer limits, and it wasn't a\npleasant way to enter the town: the trail exits right next to a factory.\n\nThere were also no waymarks as I got into town telling me which way the trail\nwould go tomorrow, so I had to pop open Google Maps and figure out how to\nactually get into the town. After a wrong turn I made it to the town center.\nFinding the cabin took a bit more effort, and figuring out where to go in was\nalso tricky, I even had to call the host in order to figure out where to go.\n\nI settled in and began laying out my cold wet gear in order for it to try out.\nThe place had a TV, which was nice, and the bed was big and comfy. I made the\nlast of my backpacking meals for dinner, and discarded the rest. I was looking\nforward to a good nights sleep.\n\n";
