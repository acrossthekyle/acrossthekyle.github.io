With a couple of\nbars of cell signal, I opened up the weather app to see if any rain was due in\nthe near future. Sure enough, there it was: rain due in 30 minutes. I opted to\nskip cooking breakfast, and just chowed down on some protein bars as I packed\nup and hit the trail with my rain jacket on.\n\nSure enough, about 30-40 minutes later the first rain drops started to fall.\nThat's ok though, I thought, I've got a waterproof backpack and a good rain\njacket to keep me dry. Just as a precuation I had also put on my polyester\njoggers (which were not waterproof) in order to provide some sort of rain\nprotection as I hiked. The shoes were another story, sure they would get wet but\nthey would also dry out quickly, if given the opportunity to do so.\n\n<Gallery images={['2022/05/07/51d57cdf-eb89-4bca-a15e-8d7c18b9f430.jpeg','2022/05/07/2861bb4d-5c37-4ae1-a123-a0cd06121439.jpeg']} title=\"Walking along the Loc through the forest\" />\n\nThe trail hugged the coastline of the Loc for the most part, mixed with multiple\ndetours into the surrounding green woods, but the waters were always somewhat\nvisible. The rain was really starting to come down now, and it was only 8am. I\npassed an iconic red telephone booth in front of a bed and breakfast place. It\nsmelled like they were serving but I wasn't hungry and wasn't defeated by\nthe rain just yet.\n\nClouds started to cling to the sides of the hills surrounding the waters. While\nmost of the trail today was a dirt path, there were plenty of rocks strewn about\nit. Some small, some large, but all of them in within my way of walking, and\nall of them slippery from the rain. Good thing these Altra trail runners had\ngood grip!\n\n<Gallery images={['2022/05/07/e6f938df-642c-4e4f-987e-2db41c13f82b.jpeg']} title=\"Clouds hugging the hills\" />\n\nI ran into a pair of mountain goats just chilling by the water under some trees,\nwaiting out the rain, unbothered. I dared not get too close because you never\nknow how a wild animal is going to react, and as soon as they caught sight of me\nI decided that it was time to move on.\n\nSmall wooden bridges with railings crossed the more rugged areas of the trail,\nespecially over freshly flowing rivers and waterfalls. The area surrounding the\ntrail was full of bright green foliage, and colorful wildflowers. The trail\nmeandered through open clearings towards mornings end, removing what little\nprotection there was from the trees.\n\nMoss-covered stones of old ruins popped up here and there along the way, but\nthere were no signs to indicate if they were of importance or not. Doesn't\nmatter to me, all historical/old things are cool-looking. I'd guess these\nparticular ones had been here for a while, given how much dirt and whatnot had\naccumulated within.\n\n<Gallery images={['2022/05/07/0cac726b-6a6e-43a3-a635-ceeaa430c6c1.jpeg','2022/05/07/4b535fa7-a859-4e02-ba6d-bbb6b08e2165.jpeg']} title=\"Moss-covered ruins in the woods\" />\n\nAbout an hour later I came upon a massive waterfall that ran next to a hotel,\nand luckily it was open for business. A welcomed respite from the ran, with\nsomewhere warm and dry where my things could dry off, hopefully. While they\nwere open for business, the kitchen was not, and all they had to offer was\nwater, juice, and coffee, plus some small pastries from the previous day. What\na let-down. My feet were thankful though for the rest and fresh pair of socks\nthough. I wasn't prepared for this much rain, and apparently (according to the\nlocals at the hotel) that this is the norm in Scotland. I should have done\nbetter research. I rested for maybe an hour before continuing on.\n\n<Gallery images={['2022/05/07/bff4610e-7f47-43d7-b46d-364be88255b9.jpeg']} title=\"A waterfall next to a hotel\" />\n\nThe trail led away from the hotel road and back along the lake, through a\nrocky and slippery mess. The designers of the trail must have thought people\nwould enjoy sliding, crouching, and hopping from rock to rock. Not much fun in\nthe rain though. I nearly slipped a handful of times, and had to go slow in\norder to avoid slipping in more dangerous areas. Luckily these section didn't\nlast for too long before the trail was back to a flat path. However the flat\ntrail was now a river.\n\nOn and on I marched through the steady downpour of rain, wading through wet\nand muddy trail conditions. At one point the water flowing over the trail\ncrested over the tops of my shoes, thoroughly soaking them through and through.\nAbout an hour later I came to a free place to spend the night: a hut with beds,\nfireplace, and lines to hang wet clothing. It was awfully cold in there, and I\nseriously thought about staying since I was so wet and just wanted to dry out.\nBut as I sat there and contemplated going, the rain waters started to overflow\nthe threshold at the door, and were slowly flooding the floor of the place.\nNeedless to say, I opted to keep going, especially since there was no one else\nthere and I would have been cold and alone all night.\n\n<Gallery images={['2022/05/07/11422900-91dd-4ad7-bfda-2bc149a6afd5.jpeg','2022/05/07/10064fcd-cbb6-47c2-8308-233a4a2f4819.jpeg']} title=\"The trail is now a flowing river of water\" />\n\nI pushed onwards towards Bienglas Farm, my original destination for the day.\nBy about 4 pm, or two hours since I left the hut, I arrived. I'm so glad I\ndidn't stay at that hut a while back. It's not really a farm, persay. Or at l\neast, not today it isn't, but might have been at one point. This place had hot\nshowers, a restaurant serving hot meals, and a washing/drying machine for clothes!\n\nPicking a spot for my tent was tricky, since most of the grounds were flooded,\nor on a slope, but I found a spot under a broad tree with thick leaves. I asked\nthe person who had also set their tent up there if it was ok that I joined them,\nand they said yes of course. I set up my tent, grabbed dry clothes,\nand set off for the showers.\n\n<Gallery images={['2022/05/07/a36884fb-7004-4881-9e00-16982c01c2e8.jpeg']} title=\"More ruins on the way to Bienglas Farm\" />\n\nAfter a much need hot shower (of which I probably stayed in longer than I should\nhave and used up way to much hot water), I went to the restaurant to get some\nhot food, and then off to the washing/drying machines for my laundry. With\nnothing left to do, and a non-existent desire to hang out in my tent in the\ncold wet air, I found a table in the restaruant and set up shop. A few other\nhikers joined me, as space as limited, and we conversed for most of the\nevening, and even split the laundry fee between us.\n\nGiven all that had happened today with being soaked from the rain, I had decided\nto book a hotel for the next day. I usually don't give up this quickly, but\nsomething about the weather and the loneliness of the trail made me want some\nmodern creature-comforts.\n\nI turned in around 9pm, looking forward to the dry big warm bed of a hotel the\nnext day.\n\n";
