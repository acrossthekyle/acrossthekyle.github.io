It wasn't my most favorite, even though it\nhad its fair share of amazing sights and challenging experiences. Today I would\nbe making for Fort William, and my hotel at the end of the West Highland Way.\n\nI didn't take many photos today, I was too focused on finishing and making it\nthrough the rain that hounded me all throughout the day. At least the day\nstarted with partly sunny skies. It took some searching, but I eventually\nfound where the trail continued, and made my way up and out of the town. While\ntrail started with a steep ascent to get back up into the hills and mountains,\nit was mostly flat the rest of the way, until the descent into Fort William.\n\n<Gallery images={['2022/05/07/f9d77828-6faa-40c8-bc40-3d0ce4135b47.jpeg']} title=\"Fjord\" />\n\nFjords were visible in the distance, signaling the incursion of the Atlantic\nocean. For a good while the trail went down the middle of a long and narrow\nvalley, flanked by scraggly grass-covered mountains. The trail hung to the\nright-most side of the valley, and weaved its way through the hills.\n\nAfter exiting the valley area I went up and down over several small hills, and\nin and out of forests. I didn't take many breaks on the trail today, I was,\nagain, too focused on finishing. The trail merged with a forest preserve trail\nwhich meant it would be a nice wide manicured path. The rain had also started\nto fall by this point. But my rain jacket had been on all day. In fact, I can't\nremember I time in the past three days when I wasn't wearing it.\n\n<Gallery images={['2022/05/07/72ffb178-c622-4b91-86de-337b908a8d24.jpeg','2022/05/07/80d751a4-6626-474d-83cd-0150c6ced3a4.jpeg']} title=\"Long and narrow valley with some ruins\" />\n\nUp ahead I could see the tallest mountain in the UK: Ben Nevis. I had hoped to\nsummit it the following day, but the weather would not cooperate. After about\nan hour of descending I was on mostly flat ground again, and close to the end.\nIt was a full downpour of rain by now, and I don't think I had any dry clothing\nleft on me, except for the outfit I would be wearing while I was in Fort William\nand while traveling back to my hotel in Glasgow.\n\nHere the trail left nature behind and met up with a sidewalk along a busy\nsection of road. For an hour I walked through the heavy rain, as cars sped\nby me. At least this part of the trail was waymarked. I entered the outskirts\nof the town, and had to pull up Google Maps in order to figure out where my\nhotel and the end of the trail was.\n\n<Gallery images={['2022/05/07/625b236b-d932-4192-b120-46e0ecfcb68b.jpeg']} title=\"Up and down hills, and seeing Ben Nevis in the distance\" />\n\nWhile the beginning of the trail had a ceremonious marker and beginning, the end\ndid not. It was simply a bench with a statue of some old man on it, and a sign\nthat said \"The end of the West Highland Way\". There streets around me were empty,\ndue to the rain, and there were no other hikers finishing at the same time as me,\nso this was a rather sad and lonely ending to a not-so-fun trek. Defeated, I\nheaded for my hotel and a warm bed.\n\nI spent the next day and a half warming up as best I could: the hotel heater\nwasn't working in the building so they gave me a small portable space-heater.\nNeedless to say I didn't do much exploring on the day that I arrived. The next\nmorning I went out to breakfast (the hotel didn't offer much), and shopped around\nfor a souvenior. I had to find a pin of the hike though, as I had done on all\nprevious hikes, in order to add to the collection on my backpack. I finally found\none at the last place I visited, just before having to leave to catch the evening\ntrain back to Glasgow.\n\nThe West Highland Way had been on my bucket list of hikes for a long time, and I\ngotta say that I was mostly dissapointed by it. It wasn't what I had thought it\nwould be, and it would make me doubt if I would ever want go on another thru-hike\never again.\n\n";
