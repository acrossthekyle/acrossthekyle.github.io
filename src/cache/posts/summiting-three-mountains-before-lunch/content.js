Shavano, we made sure to carry as much water as\nhumanly possible for our attempt of the DeCaLiBro-n combination route two\ndays later. The name comes from the four peaks above 14,000 feet that are all\nconnected via ridges, and thus do-able in a single day. The names are [De]mocrat,\n[Ca]meron, [Li]ncoln, and [Bro]ss. That last one is technically off-limits to\nthe public and is private land, so we didn't attempt to do it.\n\nOne good thing about this trail is that there's only about 2,000 feet of\nelevation gain from the trailhead at Kite Lake to the first peak, since we're\nstarting at 12,000 feet. We spent the night at the trailhead parking lot,\nsleeping in the car, in order to get somewhat acclimated to the elevation. It's\nnot easy starting at 12,000 feet unless you are acclimated.\n\nA lovely pink sunrise greeted us as we set out at around 7:00 am. No need for\na pre-dawn start since we didn't have much gain to make. The trail started off\nnice and gentle, and then started to climb via switchbacks as we got closer\nto the col at the base of the first peak.\n\n<Gallery images={['2021/09/09/6c51da8d-ea33-4960-97cf-536fc601c02f.jpeg']} title=\"Kite lake from above\" />\n\nThere were lots of old mining building materials lying around, mostly rusting\npieces of metal that had stained the rocks around them, and some old mine\nentrances that were now caved in.\n\nAnd did I mention that it was another hike without trees! You can see anything\nyou want at any given time, and see as far as the mountains will let you. And\nyou can see how far you have to go on the trail, which is always nice. Case-in-\npoint the views of Kite Lake did not dissapoint (it definitely looks like a\nkite).\n\nWe stopped and rested here and there. It wasn't too bad of a trail, and the\nconditions weren't as bad as Mt. Shavano from a couple of days ago. Especially\nsince we were each carrying an extra liter of water this time. And by 9am we\nwere at the col below the first summit: Democrat. Less than an hour later and\nwe made the summit. After some pictures it was time to head back down to the col,\nand start the next summit: Cameron.\n\n<Gallery images={['2021/09/09/fa1ec7f2-f8cd-4270-9e95-f7f30c7a9fbb.jpeg']} title=\"Mt. Cameron\" />\n\nThere was a lot of loose rock on the way over to Cameron, but we made it about\n1.5 hours later. We looked out and back on the trail, and out at the summit of\nDemocrat. Our spirits were definitely very high at this point! Two down, one to\ngo. Cameron was sort of shaped like a dome, which meant the trail down towards\nour next one, Lincoln, was a gentle slope.\n\nLincoln wasn't all that bad either, just some minor scrambling just below the\ntippity-top, with a long flat section in the middle between the two peaks. We\nmade the last summit by 12:30 pm. From here we could nearly see the entire trail\nfrom start to finish. Looking back at Cameron from Lincoln makes Cameron look\nlike a floating rocky island in the sky.\n\nTime to head back down, back the way we came, up and over Cameron, and then back\ndown the col below Democrat, and then the switchbacks back down to Kite Lake. We\npractically raced down the trail, eager to get back to the car and call this a\nvery big win!\n\n";
