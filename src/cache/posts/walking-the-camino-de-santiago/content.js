I bought the gear,\nresearched the cities on AirBnb, worked out the train schedule, and how often\nI would return back to Chicago.\n\nBut while looking for a place to live as a homebase that I could return to,\nthings fell apart and I wasn't able to pursue that dream, so life carried on\nas usual and nearly two years would go by before I would even think about\ngoing on another vacation.\n\nThen one day in the spring of 2018 I was talking to someone who had done several\ninternational thru-hikes, including the Camino in Spain and the \"O\" Circuit\nin Patagonia. They re-ignited the spark that lay dormant, and about a month\nlater, on a whim, I purchased a one-way non-refundable flight to Spain.\n\nI was going; no backing out or letting things get in the way.\n\n## So what is the Camino de Santiago\n\nThe Camino de Santiago, or Camino, or The Way, is a network of trails leading\nto the city of Santiago de Compostela in northwestern Spain. They start from\nall over Europe, and have been continously in use since medieval times. The\nmost popular route is the Camino Frances which goes from the border of France\nall the way to the Atlantic ocean. It's a roughly 500 mile journey by foot\nthat goes through several autonomous regions of Spain, and through various\nbiomes.\n\n<World\n  markers={[\n    {\n      left: '42.3%',\n      top: '23%',\n    },\n  ]}\n/>\n\nReasons for doing the Camino vary from person to person, some do it for\nreligous reasons (since it's named after Saint James), while the rest do it\nfor \"sport\". Either way, I can attest to the experience being a spiritual\nretreat from modern life.\n\nIt can be walked at any time of the year, however summer is the most popular\ntime and most of the places to stay, called Albergues, are open. These are\nhostel-like accomodations, but only for those walking the Camino. They\nprovide a dormitory-style sleeping setup, showers and bathrooms, and usually\na kitchen to cook in.\n\nAlong the Way I stayed in a variety of places, from the hostel-like Albergues\nto sleeping in the attics of churches. Some will be as nice as a hotel, others\nas nice as a bed-and-breakfast, and others as rustic as a church attic. Either\nway, there's always a place to sleep.\n\n<Gallery images={['2018/06/02/5b5ce1cd-ead3-4ffd-8ef9-eeb23e38d69b.jpeg','2018/06/02/659ee307-7d63-4760-8a60-dda426063d38.jpeg']} title=\"Examples of places I stayed in Mazarife and Sansol\" />\n\n## Preparing for the trip\n\nHaving grown up in the Midwestern states, I always defaulted to thinking that\nevery other place in the world is probably mostly flat as well. With that in\nmind my training involved walking along the lakefront in the flat city of\nChicago, and it did not involve any sort of gym-based training.\n\nTurns out it didn't matter how much training I did because I was in the same\nshape as everyone else: tired and broken at the end of each day. The Camino\nwears you down, and then builds you back up. I developed my endurance and\nability to walk 20-40 miles each day while on the Camino. By the end of the\ntrip I was walking everywhere without issue.\n\n## What I brought\n\nWithout any sort of backpacking gear in my possession I headed to REI. Here I\nhad to get a lot of help from store employees with regards to what I needed to\nget. I had a loose idea of the various pieces of gear I would need, but no idea\nwhere to start. Thankfully I was paired with an employee who had gone before,\nand knew what I needed. None of it was too heavy, and it was a good starter kit.\n\nHere are some essentials for a succesful Camino:\n\n<Checklist\n  items={[\n    'Sleeping bag liner',\n    'Extension cord',\n    'Pillow',\n    'Treking poles',\n    'Trail runners',\n    'Lightweight pack',\n    'Extra water bottle',\n    'Advil',\n  ]}\n/>\n\nThere's no requirements for sleeping gear in the places I stayed, but a sleeping\nbag liner was a good item to bring in order to have a barrier between me and\nthe beds I slept in as a way to prevent attracting bed bugs. As well as a\npillow since there wasn't always one in a bed.\n\nAnd an extension cord helped me charge my items while in bed when the outlet was far\naway.\n\n## Where I walked\n\nI wasn't sure how many miles I would be able to do each day, and since I didn't\nhave to reserve any places in advance it was easy to just pick up and go, and\nwalk as far as I wanted to and then pay for a bed whenever I was ready to. Some\ndays I felt like going far, and other days were shorter.\n\n<Stages />\n\nThere was no shortage of fellow pilgrims on this trip, and by the third day\nI had become part of a group that I would walk with for nearly two weeks.\nAnd when I had to leave them behind in Burgos I found my group that I would end\nup walking with all the way from Hontanas to the Atlantic ocean: nearly three\nweeks together. We still keep in touch to this day, and are working on planning\nto do another Camino together in the near future.\n\n";
