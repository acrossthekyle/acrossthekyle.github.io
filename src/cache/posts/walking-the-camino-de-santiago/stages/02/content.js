After randomly shoving things\ninto my bag I did one last check before heading downstairs.\n\nAfter grabbing what looked like edible (and hopefully healthy) food from the\nvending machine I retrieved my boots from the smelly storage room, placed my\nbackpack on a bench in the inner courtyard, and took a step out the front door.\n\nChilly morning air greeted me as I stood there in front of the rolling hills\nand mountains that we conquered yesterday. The world here was calm, and relaxed.\n\nThe others had arrived downstairs when I returned to fetch my bag. With food\nin bags, shoes tied, and light jackets on, we set out.\n\nWe (Amy and I) were forced to walk in the street due to the mud-filled paths\nleading away from the Monastery. The road took us through a small town a few\nkilometers away from Roncesvalles. We found our way down a small slope at the\nend of the village, and returned to the trail with trees on our left, and cows\non our right. We tried talking to the horses but they weren't being very\nresponsive.\n\nI stopped for a brief moment to turn around and take in the sunrise as it\ncrested over the hills behind us. 30 minutes later we were heading into another\nquiet town. We took a short break at the only cafe that was open.\nThe path took us back in to the trees, and up more hills. Our conversation\nreturned to where it had left ended from the previous day. Music kept us company\nas we spent the next hour hiking through dense woods with open grass prairies\nappearing through breaks in the trees.\n\nThis day was full of ups and downs and all of it was beautiful and breathtaking.\nSometimes it is hard to enjoy the amazing world around you when you have to\nfight for every step. I wish I had taken it all in with more frequent stops.\n\nA small stream followed us along the concrete path as we descended. The stream\neventually got louder and bigger until finally we were upon a river with its\nwater rushing over the concrete. In order to cross this water we had to step\nalong the tops of short concrete pillars that acted somewhat like a dam.\n\nOn the other side of this river the path led up to a bar on the side of the\nroad, and we didn't hesitate. 9:30 am on a Sunday was the perfect time for beer\nand wine when you're on the early days of the Camino.\n\nThe terrain around us alternated between bare rock and dense trees. Eventually\nwe came to a fork in the path, and the break in the trees gave us a perfect\nview of the tree-covered hills in the distance. Nothing but hills and trees as\nfar as we could see with blue skies, and white clouds hovering near the horizon.\n\nAt this point we had started on our way down towards Zubiri.\n\nThe ground became unrelenting with the bedrock turned up at a 45 degree angle,\nand each edge of each protruding rock looking like a razor sharp knife. These\nparts were also covered with slippery mud.\n\nUp ahead on the other side of a curve in the highway was a small snack stand.\nIt had a basket for women to donate their underwear, and the reward for your\ndonation was a wish being granted to you that you would meet your future husband\non this Camino. No underwear was donated, but we grabbed some food and relaxed.\nFamiliar faces started to arrive at the rest stop as we grabbed a table in the\nshade.\n\nOur time here was short since we were eager to finish today's route. After\nanother two hours of hiking, and nearly rolling my ankle a dozen times, we\narrived in Zubiri.\n\nUpon entering the town over the bridged river, we got lost trying to find the\nplace that we would hopefully be staying at. Eventually we found our way and\ngrabbed some beds at the small and cozy municipal Albergue.\n\nThe local cafe was called Estrella Galicia and we headed there to wait for the\nothers to arrive. The clouds had begun to roll in, and shortly after it began\nto rain. Luckily our friends arrived just before the heavy rain started to fall.\nWhile we sheltered from the rain in the cafe we met some new friends.\n\nThis night would be the first real night on the Camino: no longer would we be\nsheltered by modern conveniences. The walled fort-city that is famous for\nrunning with the bulls at Pamplona was waiting for us, and I was eager to begin\nthe next days hike through more green hills.\n\n";
