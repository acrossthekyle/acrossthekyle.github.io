Both of the neighboring bunk beds were already\nempty when I finally got up at 6am. I hopped down from the bed, and saw that\nCrissi had also left for the day. She must left very early in the morning with\nthe first wave of pilgrims. I was bummed out that I didn't get a chance to say\ngoodbye.\n\nMy shoes were still soaked with water as I took out all of the newspaper that\nI had stuffed in there yesterday. I had made plans last night to meet up with\nTania and Shelby in the morning so, with no one to wait on nor to wait on me,\nI saddled up the bag, put on my shoes, and headed their way. The other half\nof the group (Amy, Martha, Dom, Luigi, and Leon) had stayed at the first\nAlbergue outside of town.\n\nI met up with Tania, Shelby, and a new pilgrim named Steve (USA) just as they\nwere finishing up breakfast, and by 7am we were on the way to Agés.\n\nA constant light drizzle of rain decided to hang out with us as we headed\ntowards Tosantos. Steve didn't have a rain coat, so they improvised one from\nsome gas station garbage bags for him. Nothing quite like being warm and dry in\nthe rain!\n\nAfter Tosantos the others needed to rest. I decided to pull ahead of everyone\nelse in order to keep going, and told them I'd see them at the stage ender.\n\nThe rains from yesterday had left numerous water-filled landmines, and the\nclouds threatened to unload more rain upon me as I passed through Villambistia\nand Espinosa del Camino. There were tons of fountains, but no places for food.\nLuckily I had the rain-soaked peanuts still in my coat pocket from yesterday.\nBut as soon as I took them out and had a few, I threw them away. They tasted\nnasty.\n\nThe views were very similar to yesterday, and the constant drizzle made it an\nunpleasant and boring walk. I arrived in Villafranca Montes de Oca (which was\nonce a Roman city named Auca) and saw a truck-stop style diner. Food! I threw\ndown my gear outside, and rushed in before the other pilgrims behind me could\narrive. Needless to say, I was starving. The sandwiches here were massive! I\ncould only finish half of mine, but now had lunch for later. I really need to\nget better at this thing called \"planning ahead\".\n\nWith a full stomach I returned to the trail. The way out of town took me up\nabove the church and through a steep and muddy mess. It was a lonely uphill\nwalk through the mud-soaked woods. Few pilgrims were ahead or behind me.\n\nUp and down it went. Through forests, across rivers, past momuments, and onto\nsuper wide mud paths. It was here that a local trail angle had carved out a\nnice spot for herself and her dogs just before San Juan de Ortega. The puppers\nwere chasing each other through the woods, and watching them warmed me up as I\nate my snacks on a tree stump.\n\nThe monastery at San Juan in the next town offered some amazing damp wood smells\nthat you can only find in old buildings. This place had a barebones Albergue\nfor pilgrims without any amenities, and while the thought tickled my brain for\na brief moment, I wanted to push further.\n\nOne beer later, and after eating the rest of my breakfast sandwich at a bar next\nto the monastery, I was back to slugging it through the woods towards Agés. I\nwas grateful that most of the trail today was on soft earthen ground and not\nthat nasty hard pavement.\n\nI emerged from the woods and saw a tree standing like a solitary guard,\nprotecting the town behind it, with a yellow arrow painted across its trunk. It\nwas like something out of a fairytale, and as soon as I took a picture of it a\nfast wind picked up and the clouds began to break apart.\n\nWhat I saw stretched out ahead of me made my jaw drop, literally. I had never\nseen such a wonderful view. Sure, Los Arcos was a beautiful walk, but I had no\nidea that it was just one of many amazing places on The Way.\n\nRemember how I said I could see myself living in Pamplona, well…if nearly every\nSpanish village was going to be surrounded by fields like this, it was going to\nbe hard to choose one.\n\nI sat outside in the warm sun, letting the breeze dry my laundry, snacking on my\nchocolate as Tania, Shelby, and Steve arrived.\n\nIn the hills behind the village there was an excavation site for pre-historic\nanimals, and humans, at Atapuerca. For five euros a local bus picked us up from\nthe town fountain and took us to the museum built near the site. From there\nanother one took us up to the actual dig.\n\nThey apparently found this cave by accident on the Matagrande Plain, so it’s not\nhard to imagine how many hidden gems are beneath your feet at this very moment.\nSteve (who is a Spanish teacher back in the states) translated everything that\nthe guide told us about the areas history and how ancient humans had used the\ncave, how they had found it, and the things that they excavated.\n\nI will say this though: as fun as that was, it felt weird riding on a bus on the\nway back as we passed fellow pilgrims walking on the road. As if being in a\nmotorized vehicle was wrong.\n\nAll-in-all it was a great day filled with good walking, good weather, picture\nperfect scenery, and enjoying a home-cooked meal from the hospitalarios. Some\nof us even got a little (ok a lot) drunk on the wine, and they were hilarious\nat dinner. Tomorrow was the next big city on our trek: Burgos. It was also\npossibly the last time that I would be seeing all of the people that I had met\nso far.\n\n";
