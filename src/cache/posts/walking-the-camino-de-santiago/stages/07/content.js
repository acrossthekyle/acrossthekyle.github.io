Bright burning reds, soft glowing pinks, and warm\nexpanding yellows filled the sky outside our windows and rested upon the fields\nbeneath it. I can't recall ever seeing such a beautiful sight of nature so\nearly in the morning.\n\nI stole a look back at Monjardin from across the fields as we headed up the hill\nand out of Torres del Rio. For the first time on this trip I had the ability to\nmeasure the distance travelled from the previous day, and it was humbling.\n\nDecorative cairns stacked in the most unbelievable formations lay on either side\nof our path through the hills. Several trees also had decorations hanging from\nthem, mostly colorful ribbons. Each one a donation, or a sign of respect, for\nsomeone or something.\n\nAs we left the cairns behind and entered the farmland old stone benches and\nabandoned farm houses appeared every so often. Most of the buildings that were\nbuilt into the hill side (which still had roofs) had been destroyed by other\npilgrims using them for a quick relief.\n\nSeveral steep ascents and descents crept up out of no where as we left one\nfarming area for another. One of our French traveling companions showed us how\nto walk downhill \"like a monkey\" in order to keep the strain off of our knees.\nIt looked funny and felt awkward, but worked!\n\nViana stood in the distance as we returned to the highway shoulder. Some cars\nhonked in encouragement, and others gave us cold stares.\n\nWe did some window shopping as we walked toward the church for our break. I\nbought a new full-brimmed hat because my Lollapalooza one just wasn't cutting\nit: one burned neck too many.\n\nThe church, what was left of it, was beautiful on the inside despite the\nunassuming wooden door at its entrance. Adjacent to the church stood what is\nnow an open-air courtyard, but in historic times was another interior section\nof the church. A fire had ripped through in the 13th century, nearly destroying\nthe lot of it.\n\nOur time here was brief, and we took what appeared to be the back alleys out\nfrom the city and once more into the countryside. I am beginning to feel at\nhome walking on these dirt paths through fields and grasses and trees. The\ntimes we spend in large cities feel foreign.\n\nArrows and messages made of pebbles to friends from pilgrimages long ago dot the\nsides of the trail as we walk towards Logrono.\n\nWooden steps take us over the highway. I stare back at Viana, now so small, in\nthe distance. Another reminder of how far I've gone, and how far I have to go.\n\nRain, our friend for so many of these days, decided to pay us another visit.\nHere the path turned back to pavement made of concrete and asphalt. Several\ncaterpillars are racing from one side of the path to another, desparate to get\nsomewhere, and to avoid being trampled. I took my steps with care in order to\navoid them.\n\nSigns told us we had left the Navarre region and were now in La Rioja, an area\nknown for their red wine.\n\nWe walked along the Ebro river, through the various city parks, the ground\nshining from the freshly fallen rain.\n\nUp ahead is the Puente de Piedra our way into the city, and one final set of\nstairs, before we can find a place to rest.\n\nThe city streets leading us through the old town are nearly empty, most people\ninside back at work. We walked all the way to the tourist center at the other\nend of the town to get a map. The Camino was not well marked inside the city,\nand we did not have a guidebook with us. We found a few places to try near the\nMunicipal Albergue, and started with that one.\n\nThey had beds, but for whatever reason they demanded to keep our passports while\nwe stayed there. None of us felt comfortable with that, so we headed back down\nthe street towards a place near the edge of the old town and, being satisfied\nwith the price for a bed and dinner, decided to call it home for the night. It\nwas a good choice.\n\nLogrono is a beautiful city with its streets artfully decorated, and the massive\nchurch at its center commanding attention with each ring of the bells. We found\nMartha, Amy, and Tracey relaxing with everyone we had met so far on the Camino\nin the main square watching the townspeople set up for a festival this evening\n(please let it not be loud).\n\nOk, so Logrono wasn't that bad of a big city, but honestly I'm looking forward\nto Najera tomorrow and the smaller city scene. My small Lolla hat was beginning\nto show its limits with sun protection. I might need to look into buying a real\nsun hat.\n\n";
