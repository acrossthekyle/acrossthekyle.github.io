Tomorrow\nwe will be arriving in the city that has been at the edges of our minds for\nnearly 30 days. We all took a late start today. Doing nearly 45 kilometers of\ntotal walking in one day will make you want to do that.\n\nBoente was our first stop, for breakfast of course. According to the guide book\nthere was a priest here who would give blessings to pilgrims. No priest, but we\nsettled for the stamp since you have to get two per day now in order to get\nyour certificate at the end.\n\nSeveral small towns came and went as we walked today. The sun was high in the\nsky, and I could already feel the sunburn setting in. We were taking our time\ntoday, and Arz√∫a was our next stop after a couple hours of walking.\n\nThere wasn't much activity on the trail today, mostly just heads-down walking.\nWe arrived in Arca / O Pedrouzo around 5pm. Such a slow day, but then again it\nwas still more than 30 kilometers of walking and we had a late start. The rain\nwas threatening to arrive at any moment as we tried to reconnect with Eileen\nand Mauro via free WiFi at a local bar.\n\nWe tried four different places before finding beds in a hotel/Albergue called\nPorta de Santiago. Not too bad of a place considering it wasn't that expensive.\nEileen and Mauro met up with us there and got some beds as well.\n\nApparently there is a concert going on this weekend in Santiago, so based on the\nadvice by Eileen we started looking into making a reservation anywhere we could\nin order to ensure that we had a place to stay. But all of the Hostels and\nAlbergues were filling up quickly. We'll just have to wing it.\n\nI can't believe that this month long journey is coming to an end tomorrow.\n\n";
