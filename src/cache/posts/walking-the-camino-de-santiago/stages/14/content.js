Someone else from the other dormitory had the same idea, and added\ntheir stuff to the mess. We finished our morning routines and headed down the\nstairs.\n\nThere's really only one thing that can stop you from getting an early start, and\nthat would be a locked door. Thirteen days of walking to, and sleeping in,\nvarious places. You'd think that we would have learned to ask what time the\ndoors open. After some exploring we found our escape through the kitchen door,\nand around the back of the building.\n\nWith head torches aglow we headed up into the hills and out of town. There’s not\nmuch to see when it’s dark out, and you walk so much faster without the heat\npressing down on you. Our small group for the day consisted of Bianca, Crissi,\nand Maddy (the pilgrim who joined us in the hallway) from the UK.\n\nThe rising sun filled the sky with a beautiful pink as headed towards\nCastrojeriz. Up ahead a massive structure begin to take shape. It was the\nConvento de San Antón: an old pilgrim hospital which was started by the Order\nof St. Anthony in the 11th century. All that's left now are the ruins of it,\nbut the road cut right through the middle of it.\n\nArches toward above us as we walked through the ruins. The pink stone arches of\nthis once massively tall structure framed the road perfectly as we continued\ntowards the castle on the hill in the distance.\n\nThe road took us through groves of trees before crossing a small river.\nCastrojeriz was in full view as we took the exit off of the small country\nhighway and towards the town. The church seemed so large when compared to the\nhouses around it.\n\nOh, and did I mention that there wasn't a single cloud in the sky today? Talk\nabout beautiful.\n\nBianca showed us her coffee skills as we rested at the cafe across from the\nchurch. She competes in the Olympics of coffee making, and gets to work with it\nall day long, for a living.\n\nUp the stone road we went, taking a detour around the southern side of the\ncastle on the hill, and in doing so nearly stepped on a praying mantis! The\nlittle guy was standing as stiff as a statue in the middle of the street. But\nhe was kind enough to let us take some pictures of him.\n\nAhead of us lay an old Roman road which led to the big elevation gain for the\nday: Alto de Mostelares. Maddy and I were in the power walking groove with our\ntrekking poles, and we didn’t flinch as we hit the incline. It took us about 10\nminutes to get to the top, and holy shit were we out of breath when we reached\nit. I don’t think I was this out of breath when we crossed the Pyrenees.\n\nThe walk down was hard. My poor knees…\n\nFlat ground awaited us on our way to the next oasis. The power walking didn’t\nease up either. Maddy and I arrived at the Fuente al Pioja about 40 minutes\nlater and chucked our gear aside. We probably spent close to an hour resting\nhere. The sun was shining bright, the clouds were absent from the sky, and the\nshade felt damn good. Plus, there was a snack stand set up with food. Fruit\nplease!\n\nWe came to the San Nicolás Chapel. It was a barebones place with no electricity\nwhich means, gasp, no wifi. But the thought of staying there was tempting, just\nto disconnect from it all for once. Once over the bridge which crossed the Rio\nPisuerga we entered Palencia, and the Tierra de Campos region.\n\nThe headphones went in, the music was turned on, and I beat the shit out of that\ngravel path with my trekking poles. The heat had turned up, and I wanted to get\nto some shade, which was still 6 kilometers away. Maddy had the same idea, and\nshe kept in time with her music, each of us using the beat to power walk. We\nmatched tempos and were soon making great time.\n\nItero de la Vega was the next town, and it was calling out to us for lunch. The\nsandwiches were served hot, the beer cold, and I fell backwards into my chair\nas I tried to stand up. Maybe I need to slow down a bit. Gently rolling hills\noutside of Itero de la Vega greeted us for the longest stretch of today. No\nwater, no shade, good music, rolling hills, what more could you ask for?\n\nWith beast mode turned on it took Maddy and I about an hour to get to the shade\nand stop for the day at Boadilla del Camino.\n\nDuring our speed walking, we realized that Crissi and Bianca had fallen far, far\nbehind. We waited with the most friendly of cats at the park on the edge of the\nvillage for an hour, but they never showed up. It was too early in the day to\ncall it quits and, oddly enough, we were aching for more walking.\n\nBad idea.\n\nThe walk from Boadilla to Fromista was nearly just as long as the previous\nstretch, and along an old river canal (Canal de Castilla) that looked like it\nwas no longer used. We were very relieved when we entered town at three in the\nafternoon. Today came close to 10 hours of pure walking. Not bad. But we both\nknew that it was going to start hurting soon.\n\nHappy to be at another large town, we checked in at the closest place to stay\nand settled in. The World Cup was going on while we were in Spain, and Maddy’s\nCamino friend Luis was staying at the same Albergue, so we joined him at night\nfor the game.\n\nIt was officially decided that we shouldn’t have pushed so hard today. But hey,\nsecond longest day! Crissi and Bianca did indeed make it to the previous town\nat Boadilla after we had left, and decided to camp there for the night. But\nwe'll see them tomorrow in Carrion, the town just before what I would later\nlearn is called The Wasteland.\n\nWith a name like that, I'm not looking forward to it.\n\n";
