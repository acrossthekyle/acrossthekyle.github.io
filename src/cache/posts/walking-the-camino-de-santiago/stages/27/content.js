It was 6 am\nwhen our hosts decided to turn on the lights. Talk about a rude awakening.\nEveryone was forced to get up and out of bed at the same time, which led to\nminor amounts of chaos in the dormitory.\n\nThe way out of town and back to the Camino was through the same way that we\nentered it: over the bridge. This town technically wasn't on the original\nCamino path anymore because they had to move it to higher ground after they\nflooded the valley a long time ago.\n\nWe hiked uphill, passed corn storage houses, and through the charred remains\nof a forest. 90 minutes later we came to Castromaior after passing through\nGonzar. They have a restaurant at this Albergue, which means food, and we were\nstarving!\n\nAs we're walking in, a pilgrim is on their way out. It was Eileen! Such pure\nfate. Crissi and I are happy to be reunited with a travel companion after\nsaying goodbye only just yesterday. We ate our breakfast and hit the trail again.\n\nI noticed that Eileen was walking without her sticks, and I commented on how\nimpressed I was that she was going uphill without them. \"F\\*\\*K!\", she said. Her\npoles were resting comfortably back at the Albergue we had breakfast at. She\nwas forced to turn around, while Crissi and I marched on. Why we didn't turn\nback with her, I do not know. A few moments later and we were walking uphill\nagain.\n\nJust outside of Castromaior were the ruins of a Roman encampment. I couldn't\npass up this opportunity to actually walk through history, to be able to reach\nout and touch it. You can see where the fires were, the kitchens, and even the\nbathrooms. You just don't get a chance like this back home in the States with\nhistorical landmarks: they're usually roped off.\n\nAfterwards we waited for Eileen at a restaurant outside of Hospital Alta da Cruz.\nAfter she arrived we got back on the trail. Palas de Red was the next big city,\nand the chance for a good solid lunch, during which we unanimously decided to\n\"turn on Beast Mode\" and push for Melide, about 14 kilometers away.\n\nIt was a hard walk, but we had a great time and did plenty of talking. We were\nnearly dead when we arrived in the outskirts of Melide though. Upon reaching the\nbridge into town, we ran into Mauro placing a hand written note on the bridge\ntelling us to meet him in town. It was so darn cute.\n\nNow we're all together again! We found a great place to stay with a nice green\nbackyard. When we were heading out to dinner I ran in to Sam! I'm glad to see\nthat he is finishing the Camino, 40 pound backpack and all.\n\nMelide is well known for its Pulpo a la Gallega, which is boiled octopus served\nwith olive oil, paprika, bread, and white wine in a bowl. We didn't shy\naway from having some.\n\nSo much unexpected joy today. Random surprises from familiar faces can ease the\nsoul in so many ways.\n\n";
