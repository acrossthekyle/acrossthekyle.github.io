The only thing illuminated is the\nsmall stretch of ground directly in front of you.\n\nOur pace was brisk as we crept through the darkness. On the way through\nPereje we passed a pilgrim who was returning to Villafranca at the same pace\nthat we were moving away from it. She must have forgotten something. I can relate.\n\nWe continued on, under and over highways, through wooded paths next to rivers,\nand in front of rock faces that were being held back by cages of wire. Our\npre-determined group meeting point was at Trabadelo, and we arrived early,\naround 7am. Everything was closed, it being Monday morning and all, so we\ncontinued on through a series of small cute towns until arriving at Ambasmestas,\nand had breakfast at a hotel cafe.\n\nOn the way to Herrerias, the next stop, we came across a very talkative duck in\nsomeones yard. I tried talking to him but he just wasn't having it. Herrerias\nwas the last town before beginning our ascent up the mountain. We decided to\ncontinue along once we got there instead of waiting for the others behind us to\ncatch up. The way was via the verys steep road initially, and eventually we\ncame to a dirt path, but this was the steepest portion yet.\n\nBecause our friend Maddy was far behind us, we left her a message written in\nsmall stones at one of the Camino markers. We found out later on that she never\nsaw it, and instead heard of it from others, which made her happy all the same.\n\nThe hike up the mountain was through thick forest which meant we didn't have to\nworry about the sun beating down on us as we climbed this steep path. We crushed\nthe first part (i.e. walked very fast, and passed many others) and took a brief\nrest in the town of La Faba. While we were resting near the towns fountain a\nlocal farm family decided to let their bulls and donkey out for a stroll\nthrough the streets. This isnâ€™t something that you see every day.\n\nLaguna (a town, not the beach) was the next milestone to reach upon this\nmountain. We also raced up this portion, and I can't remember why, maybe I was\nin a hurry to be done with the ascent, who knows. We grabbed some cokes and\nrelaxed as we watched others come to the top. After that we went to our\ndestination at O'Cerbreia, which was via a gradually rising trail up from Laguna.\n\nAlong the way we crossed over into the next autonmous region: Galicia. We are\nnow officially in the region of Santiago de Compostela.\n\nThe views are amazing up here at O'Cerbreia: mountains and rolling hills as far\nas the eye can see. I simply can't take enough pictures of it. This Albergue, I\nthink the only one up here, was very primitive. The showers lacked curtains, and t\nhe beds were practically stacked on top of each other. And the \"town\" feels like\na tourist trap.: two full-blown gift shops, and a museum church.\n\nWe grabbed some drinks with everyone after they all arrived. Luis had the\nhardest journey today: he went up and down three major hills and had to\nbushwhack the whole way because he took a wrong turn. Dinner was alright,\nnothing amazing. Hopefully it isn't too stuffy in this Municipal tonight.\n\n";
