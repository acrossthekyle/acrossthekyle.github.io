Once the lights came on it was nearly\nimpossible to try and ignore the fact that another day had begun. We've been\nlazy lately by allowing ourselves to sleep in, but we're not complaining.\nBusiness as usual: pack your bag, grab toast and jam (which no longer suffices\nas breakfast), brush your teeth, and head out. Crissi was the last to join us\nin the courtyard, and we started walking.\n\nStone streets glistened in the light of the rising sun as it shown down middle\nof the avenue as we passed by the cathedral. After a quick stop for some coffee\nwe said goodbye to the old city center and started to head out of town.\n\nIt took most of the morning for us to even make it out of the city.\n\nThe Way went past the scenic landmarks towards the Plaza de San Marcos which had\nseveral monuments to the pilgrims. We crossed the Rio Bernesga and walked\nthrough more metropolitan areas, some of them industrial with fields of weeds\nopposite their gray buildings.\n\nFinally after a short uphill gain, walking along a busy highway, and two hours\nlater, we arrived in Virgen del camino. Starving, we stopped at a small bar on\nthe side of the road. Crissi and Bianca were amazed that we had been walking\nthrough Le√≥n this whole time, and only now finally left the city behind.\n\nWe picked up a new companion to walk with us for the day: Kim from Australia.\n\nThe time had come for a decision: stay on the highway and go down the alternate\nroute, or follow the traditional scenic route. Crissi and I remembered how\nbadly we had been burned (literally) the last time we chose the scenic route.\nChiro had also told us that the scenic route was terrible but we decided to\nignore his advice because no one wanted to spend three hours walking along a\nbusy noisy highway.\n\nOur scenic route had to cross through a scraggly patch of earth in order to\ncross one more highway. Luckily it was an underpass which took us to Fresno del\nCamino, but we left the town almost as fast as we had entered it for there\nwasn't much to see.\n\nOncina was the next town after Fresno. We stopped at a small church after\ncrossing the bridge into town. Disappointed that the snack shop next to the\nchurch wasn't open we stocked up on water at the fountain and took the small\npaved road as it transitioned into a pleasant dirt path through the fields.\n\nAt last, the scenic route had arrived.\n\nSure, it was still mostly flat. But it still possessed enough of a change to\nkeep it interesting. And, we were surrounded by vegetation on all sides. One\nthing we won't be escaping any time soon though is the red dirt. Looks like\nthis shit will be following us for quite a while.\n\nI walked fast today, and quickly pulled ahead of the others. Nothing but gently\nrolling fields dotted with islands of ground green trees kept me company as I\npushed myself past shady rest areas. The dirt path gradually shifted back into\na paved road, which sucks. But the sun was out, the sky empty, and thankfully\nthe heat was late to the party.\n\nA spare pair of shoes stood on a marker as an offering to any pilgrim who might\nneed them. Besides the plants growing inside of them, and the absence of\nshoelaces, they were in pretty good shape. And to be honest, the thought of\ngrabbing them briefly crossed my mind, but then I thought of the extra weight\nand quickly discarded the idea.\n\nChozas de Abajo, and a much needed break, appeared in the distance as I topped\nthe next hill. I waited at the entrance of the town for the others to catch up\nand see me. I slowly headed into the center whilst making sure that they were\nstill behind me. We found the only open establishment and took a break on its\nfront porch.\n\nWhen we walked up and dropped our bags I recognized Drew whom I had briefly met\nin Pamplona while walking around with Tania. And a few moments later another\nPilgrim arrived and joined us at our table. Her name was Cerstin from Germany,\nand she had started her camino in Burgos.\n\nI'm not sure who suggested it, but there was an albergue up ahead that had a\nswimming pool. It was a no brainer, given the high temps over the past few\ndays. So, our home for the night would hopefully be Casa de Jesus.\n\nOn the walk to Mazarife I grilled Cerstin on the political systems of Germany.\nIt was a nice way to pass the next hour.\n\nWe arrived at Casa de Jesus, and sure enough, there it was: the swimming pool.\nWe were eager to strip down to our skivvies and go for a dip, especially in\nthis hot sun, but first we needed to do some shopping for dinner.\n\nAfterwards we sat chatting with Louis, Crissi, Kim, Cerstin, Hannah\n(Germany), and Drew. We went over all of the things that are different between\nBritish, German, Aussie, and American culture. It was hilarious, especially the\nanimal noises.\n\nOnce the sun finally moved out of high position in the sky Cerstin and I swam in\nthe pool for a bit before cooking dinner.\n\nOur meal cost a total of 14 euros, which isn't bad for 8 people. The kitchen was\ntiny, and everyone needed to use it, so we made sure to not use all of the\nelectric stove burners again and trip another circuit breaker.\n\nAs we all sat down to eat it was nice to see the table fill up with friends who\nwere slowly becoming like family. Dinner consisted of another lovely course of\nsalad, pasta with capers, and bread.\n\nI sat outside for a while afterwards chatting with Cerstin and Drew. Drew, it\nturns out, got his entire camino trip sponsored by entering a contest of sorts\nin which he would promise to write about the Camino and promote the websites\nbrand. Not a bad idea!\n\nMaddy, who has a younger sister, found out that her sister will be arriving\nlater tonight and will join us on the Camino starting tomorrow.\n\nThe gray clouds in the distance were slowly growing in size, pushing their way\nhigher and higher into the sky, as a busload of children arrived. They stayed\nin another part of the Albergue and would be doing two days of the Camino,\nstarting tomorrow.\n\nWe watched the clouds as they moved closer. Tomorrow was going to be another 30+\nkilometer day, and hopefully the rain would pass us by.\n\n";
