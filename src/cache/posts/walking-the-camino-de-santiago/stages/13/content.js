After one last check in the\nlocker I rolled up my sleeping liner and headed to the cafeteria to see what\nthey had for breakfast. All they had was cold food consisting of cereal and\ntoast, which was fitting for my current mood. I sat alone at a long table with\nmy bag next to me, trying to eat as much as I could.\n\nShit! I realized I had forgotten my towel. It was probably hanging off the end\nof the bed back in the room. Luckily Tania was awake and answered the door\nafter a few soft taps. I gave her another firm hug before saying goodbye for\ngood. This was getting real now.\n\nI took the stairs down to the street below, and stepped out into the cold air.\nThe city was slowly waking up.\n\nAt this moment I realized that I had no idea how to get out of the city.\nEveryone that I had been walking with so far had the guidebook, or knew enough\nSpanish to ask for help. It also didn't help that we stayed at a place off of\nthe main path, far from any markers. Then I remembered someone told me last\nnight to follow the river, going in the opposite direction.\n\nI've never felt so helpless and nervous. The river was easy enough to find, and\nI followed it blindly as it flowed beneath me. For a long time there weren't\nany other pilgrims ahead, or behind, and I started to have a minor panic\nattack. Finally I saw some ahead of me, and at the same moment the markers on\nthe ground returned. Crisis averted.\n\nThe first mistake of the morning was slowly becoming apparent to me. I had not\nfilled up my Camelbak before leaving because I assumed that public fountains\nwould be on and running. Apparently they turn them off at night, and don't turn\nthem on again until later in the day. I felt another panic attack coming.\n\nAs I left the city behind and entered the familiar world of the gravel path and\ngreen fields, I came across a stone marker that made me want to cry.\n\nStanding in front of me is a pink heart with a crack going down the middle of\nit, and that perfectly summed up how I was feeling. I was now an hour away from\neveryone that I had grown so close to over the last several days, with no hopes\nof ever seeing them again.\n\nI pushed my feelings aside, and decided that they wouldn’t bring me down today.\n\nQuick work was made of the walk to Tarjados where I grabbed another, more\nfilling, breakfast, filled up on water and then headed through Rabé de las\nCalzadas a short distance later.\n\nOnce I left Rabé the heat, and flies, began to rise. Little did I know but I was\nentering the Meseta on June 14th, and a heatwave was beginning to sweep across\nSpain at the same time.\n\nThe flies were my unwanted traveling companions on this 30+ kilometer day, and\nthey did not want to leave me alone. But, there was silver lining to this swarm\nof annoying flies, and that was a swarm of white butterflies.\n\nI crested a hill and was surrounded by hundreds of them. They kept the flies\naway, and it was like walking through a dream. Sadly I have no pictures of this\namazing world, I was too focused on pushing through this day.\n\nBesides the flies, and the heat, the world around me was once again composed of\nblue sky, green fields, and white clouds. This is my element. This is where I\nfeel at home.\n\nSome benches stood in front of a bar at the edge of Hornillos del Camino. As I\nsat there eating my sandwich some Brits were staring at me, and I tried my best\nto ignore there eyes. Further up the road was the town square so I headed\ntowards it and the Church. I grabbed a table by a fountain in front of the\nchurch, and enjoyed the rest of my sandwich along with a beer from the bar.\n\nAs much as I was enjoying myself in the sun, there was still plenty of walking\nleft to do. The ground after Hornillos was flat as far as the eye could see.\nHere and there piles of rocks in the distance gave the illusion of buildings\nand salvation from the flies and the heat (oh yes, the flies immediately\nreturned once I left the village behind).\n\nAccording to the map they had given me back in St Jean there was supposed to be\na rest stop after 26 kilometers called San Bol. Only one ruined building\nremained in the fields of grass. Disheartened, I cracked on.\n\nNext came a sign promising a place to sleep in 500 meters. Then another sign\npromising the same in 250 meters. Then another at 50 meters. 50 meters is\nexactly 164.042 feet. You can see 164 feet in front of you, right? 164 feet in\nfront me was nothing, just more flat grasslands filled with flies.\n\nI started cursing out loud because I was running low on water, very hot, and my\nfeet were killing me. Then, out of nowhere, Hontanas rose from the ground like\nthe cave filled with gold in Aladdin. First the top of the church, then the\ntops of buildings, and finally a street that led down and into sanctuary. The\nentire city was built below the level of the surrounding terrain.\n\nWords alone cannot describe how I felt.\n\nAt the top of the gravel road leading into town were some other pilgrims.\nHopefully they were American. My greeting started as a simple \"hey\" to the\nperson closest to me, but quickly turned into a cry of excitement as I saw who\nit was, and I nearly collapsed on them as I gave them a hug.\n\nDisbelief overcame me as I stepped back and turned to look further down the\nroad. There was Bianca who I had seen during the earlier days of the Camino at\nNajera, and a new pilgrim named Mauro from Italy. And of course there was the\nperson whom I had just assaulted with a hug. This was the person who had left\nso early in the morning nearly three days ago in Belorado without saying\ngoodbye. But there she was, standing two feet away from me. I was so happy to\nbe able to say hello, once again, to Crissi.\n\nRelief, joy, and a multitude of other feelings overcame me, and I could not wipe\nthe look of happiness off of my face as we went into town, booked beds, and\nrelaxed in the sun. The universe had given me new and old friends to help pull\nme up and get me through one of the hardest days of my life after leaving so\nmany people behind.\n\nAnother pilgrim that Crissi recognized named Ciro stopped by our table that\nafternoon. He told us that he had done five Caminos so far! That's crazy, but I\ncan see why someone would want to come back and do this again.\n\nBianca, Crissi, Mauro, and I scrapped together what we could from the small\ntienda, and cooked dinner for each other. This was my first time on the Camino\ncooking dinner, and it couldn't have been under better circumstances. We even\nblew out the circuit breakers because we were using the electric stove so\nmuch.\n\nThe setting sun basked the rear deck in hot light as we enjoyed the fruits of\nour collective labor. It was one of the most delicious dinners I had ever had.\nCiro joined us halfway through as we were finishing up the bottle of wine.\n\nIt was decided that we would leave early in the morning to try and beat this\nintense heat that was laying on top of the world like a heavy wool blanket. The\nMeseta, the rest of the Camino, and Boadilla del Camino was waiting for us.\nLet's do this.\n\n";
