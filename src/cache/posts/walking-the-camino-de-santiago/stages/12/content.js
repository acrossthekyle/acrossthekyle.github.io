It's a good thing they served us\nbreakfast at our Albergue, or else the hunger would have helped the wind cut\neven deeper. Speaking of breakfasts, this was my first homemade breakfast on\nthe Camino. It was a simple serving of eggs and toast, but it was filling. I\nmiss having eggs for breakfast.\n\nOnce again we were arriving in the town of Atapuerca, but this time it was by\nfoot.\n\nAt the first cafe we shamelessly helped ourselves to a small second breakfast.\nA \"small\" hill greeted us as soon as we left the town. This was the same hill\nthat they were doing their excavations on, and part of it was fenced off. So\nmuch for exploring.\n\nWe made it up the hill in no time at all.\n\nA tall wooden cross stood at the top, staring out at the rolling land from which\nwe had come. On the ground behind it lay a large stone arrow pointing us in the\ndirection of Burgos off in the distance. But the structures and decorations\ndidn't stop there.\n\nLaid out on the ground ahead of us sat a weird series of concentric circles with\na single way in and out. As we watched people walking along the spiraling\nrings, Shelby recognized what it was: a silent spiral maze.\n\nEach of us took turns walking (sometimes jogging) towards the center where a\nsmall wooden cross stood. It probably took 20 minutes to do the whole thing,\nand it was such a calming experience. It’s the simples things sometimes.\n\nHowever, it was time to return to reality. Burgos was waiting for us down the\nsteep descent, and 17 kilometers away.\n\nIt was an intense walk. There was a very long stretch (nearly 14 km) without any\nstops. But, that doesn't mean it wasn’t pretty.\n\nThrough various villages we marched, finding rest stops along the way. As we\nbegan to enter the outer edges of the city, we took the route less traveled\ntowards the river entrance. It took us pass a small airport and towards the\nfactories on the cities limits.\n\nAs we came to the highway leading in, we couldn’t find a way across. After\ntrying to follow an ever-diminishing gravel path, we decided to bushwhack the\nshit out of it. We found what could barely be described as an “underpass”. It\nwas a small gap under the highway with a clearance of 3 feet and went over a\ndry riverbed. The thorns and prickly grasses on the other side wanted us to\nstay out, but we pushed through it.\n\nIt’s a good thing that we crossed when we did, because shortly thereafter all of\nthe disgusting factory smells began to invade our space. Luckily we didn’t have\nto walk through the noxious fumes for very long, for we had arrived at the\nriver, and we needed a break.\n\nBread, chocolate, and cheeses were placed in front of each other as we made a\nlittle spot for ourselves next to a bench under the trees. We saw familiar\nfaces pass by as we gorged on our delicious buffet.\n\nThe riverwalk ahead took us straight into the historic part of Burgos (it was\nlonger than we thought), and it took us nearly 30 minutes to walk the length of\nit before entering the city proper. But we did stray a bit away from the marked\npath because we decided to class it up and stay at an actual hostel\n(Hostel Burgos) with a private room for the four of us (Shelby, Tania, Philip,\nand myself). It was the first night that I didn’t have to wear earplugs. Thank\nyou friends for not snoring!\n\nAfter the usual requirements of laundry and showering, my first stop was the\ncathedral. To be honest, it’s a beautiful building on the outside, and the\ninterior is nice, but it’s set up like a museum which ruins the effect, for me\nat least. I had to speed through the tour anyways (at a cost of five euros)\nbecause Steve told me about the MEH (Museum of Human Evolution). I love\nlearning about this stuff, and the experience from the dig tour from yesterday\nwas still fresh in my mind.\n\nI ran over to the MEH (Museum of Human Evolution) to meet up with Steve and\nShelby. They had a lot of information in there. I had seen most of it before,\nbut the nerd in me always likes to geek out on this kind of stuff. Plus, it was\nfree!\n\nTania and Philip were waiting for us back at the hostel, and we all headed out\nto find a bar for the evening. As we entered the town square Amy, Martha,\nLuigi, Dom, and Leon showed up! They said they would find us later after\nwalking around for a bit.\n\nWe found a place that served tapas which each drink you ordered, it was great.\nAmy and the others showed up as we grabbed some tables and commenced indulging\nourselves. Several rounds of beer were purchased throughout the night.\n\nThey all got to chatting, and the idea of taking a relaxing day off tomorrow\ngained steam. I would have joined them, but I couldn’t afford to take any days\noff in order to finish in time. None of them had booked return flights, so they\nhad some flexibility.\n\nBut eventually the time came to say goodbye...\n\nI've walked nearly 300 kilometers for two weeks with most of them, and it was\nhard. You make such a profound impact on each other and it becomes too much\nwhen you start to think about not seeing them again, especially after all that\nyou've been through on this pilgrimage. Each one of them left a mark on me, and\nhelped make an impact on the Camino.\n\nI pushed the thought of not seeing these people again out of my head in order to\nget some sleep. Tomorrow was going to be brand new, but at the same time\nfamiliar. Hontanas is 30 kilometers, and a world of unknown, away from here.\n\n";
