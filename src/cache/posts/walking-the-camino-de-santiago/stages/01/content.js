It’s a cold brisk morning on\nJune 2nd, 2018 and I’m about to start the Camino de Santiago.\n\nAs I stood there in the early morning light on the street I tried to take stock\nof what I had come here to do, and what was about to happen. I stared down the\nroad, watching other pilgrims march up the stone-paved road and off into the\ndistance, before finally muttering to myself \"alright, let's go.\"\n\nTo be honest, I really didn't know which way to go, so I blindly followed three\npilgrims who were walking side-by-side further ahead of me. The sun was shining,\nand the clouds were few and far between, as we left the village behind and\nentered the countryside.\n\nShortly after I cleared the final threshold of buildings that separated the\nman-made world from natural world, the three ladies whom I had been following\nsuddenly stopped. As I was walking past them, now confident in the way to go,\nand I overheard one of them ask out loud \"Is this the right way?\" I offered the\nbest advice that I could give: \"Yeah, I think so.\"\n\nAnd that's all it took. I came to France alone but this pilgrimage, which\nstarted barely 30 minutes ago, was no longer a solo trip, and I had made new\nfriends. They were: Amy (USA), Martha (UK), and Tracey (AUS).\n\nWe left the stone-paved village roads behind, gradually rising above the clouds\nwith each step. Every time I turned around to stare in awe at the view in\nfront of my eyes it seemed like I was becoming further separated from the world.\n\nGradually our group splintered while we were walking and talking.\n\nAfter a while the topic of conversation turned to \"Why are you walking across\nSpain?\". I suddenly realized that I didn't know and my mind started to cloud\nwith answers as I tried to formulate something. Hopefully I'll find an answer\nto that question as this adventure continues.\n\nAround mid-morning we arrived at Orisson. We were in desperate need of a break\nsince none of us were prepared for how much constant uphill walking was\ninvolved. After resting and refueling on water we returned to the trail. The\nclouds had followed us, and we were treated to cool temperatures and fog-filled\npaths.\n\nShortly thereafter the fog left us and we were back to staring at the curving\npaved road as we continued up the mountainside. Each time I saw a curve ahead\nof us, and the road disappeared behind it, I hoped that this must be the top.\n\nThe marked way left the paved road behind shortly before reaching the border\nof Spain, near the top.\n\nHere the fog returned to us and clung to the trees, covering the path in the\nfar distance. It would still be another hour of following the road up and around\nthe mountain forest before we would come to a marker signifying that the way\ndown had begun. After more than five hours of ascending, we were finally on\nthe descent and in Spain.\n\nIt took all of my concentration to stay vertical, and to keep my feet from\ngetting stuck in the mud. The trees were dense here, and the air heavy. We\nnearly bushwhacked our way through the forest, loosing the trail and then\nfinding it a few moments later each time.\n\nShortly before exiting the woods, and entering Roncesvalles, I managed to\nslip and fall on my ass.\n\nI have never been happier to see a destination. It meant clean clothes, hot\nshowers, and companionship with the people that you struggled all day with.\nThe air was filled only with the sounds of birds chirping, pilgrims arriving and\ncleaning off their shoes, and the energy of conversation filling the dormitory\nhalls.\n\nWith our belly's full from a three course meal we said our goodbyes and\nretreated back to the monastery dorms. We found the others sitting at the\nentrance to our floor and spent the next hour talking, laughing, and getting\nto know each other.\n\nTomorrow meant more downhill hiking as we would begin descending the Pyrenees\nand make our way for Zubiri. Hopefully the rains will stay away and keep the\npath dry for us.\n\n";
