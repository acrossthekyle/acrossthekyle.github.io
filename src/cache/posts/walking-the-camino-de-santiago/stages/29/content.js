Our destination which always seemed so\nfar away, after traveling for so many days and so many miles, was finally upon\nus. It was raining so hard this morning that I thought someone had turned a fan\non next to my head. Torrents and torrents of rain battered the roof as we got\nready in the dark.  Maybe it was fitting that the start of the day would be\nfilled with rain.\n\nLuckily we did not get rained on while walking. Most of the morning was spent\ngoing through wet fields, through forests, and passed longhorn oxen. We took a\nquick stop in Monte de Gozo to see the monument there, and to get our first\nlook at the towers of the Cathedral of Santiago.\n\nAs we entered the city, the masses of pilgrims that we walked with continued\nto grow. It felt like we were all on autopilot: follow the arrows, one foot in\nfront of the other, keep going until you see a big church. Before entering the\nplaza of the cathedral, we passed through the old part of the city. As is\ntradition, since Galicia is very Celtic in its roots and culture, we were played\ninto the plaza by bagpipes in the tunnel before entering.\n\nUpon arriving in the plaza and looking at the cathedral all I could say was\n“This is it?”. I could not believe that this was the destination after\ntraveling for so many days and so many miles.\n\nAfter several photos and hugs in front of the cathedral we headed off to get\nour Compostelas (certificates for completing the Camino). This is it. It's real.\nThe journey is over.\n\nWe would not be walking the way tomorrow, but instead would be taking a much\ndeserved day to rest and explore the city.\n\nWe had breakfast and headed for the Pilgrim mass. It was a nice ceremony (it was\nall in Spanish so I couldn't understand much), but they swung the giant\nincense burner, and man could that thing swing.\n\nWe celebrated this momentous occasion at a local tapas restaurant in the center\nof the old city with our original group that set out from Hontanas nearly three\nweeks ago: Crissi, Cerstin, Mauro and Bianca. It felt weird not having to worry\nabout getting up early to walk on the way tomorrow.\n\nAfter our goodbyes I decided to go to the front of the church.  I had intended\non going alone, but Crissi and Mauro joined me. The church at night was even\nmore impressive. I stood there staring in awe at the cathedral, reflecting on\nthe journey. It nearly brought me to tears. I cannot fathom that this is over.\n\nI gave the biggest hug that I could to Crissi, and thanked her. Nothing\ndramatic, no fancy words, no glorious speech, simply \"Thank you\". Thanks for\nbefriending me in Belorado. Thanks for saving me in Hontanas. Thanks for walking\nthrough the Meseta with me. Thanks for listening to me complain about work.\nThanks for being a companion. And thanks for doing this incredible journey. I\ncouldn't have completed this without you Crissi, thank you!\n\nTomorrow we set out for Finesterre, and the zero mile marker.\n\n";
