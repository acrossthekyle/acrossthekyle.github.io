We\ndidn't roll out of bed until well after the sun was up and the other pilgrims\nhad left. I was eager to start walking, despite the lingering effects from\nyesterday. We departed for León with the goal of leaving the Meseta far, far,\nbehind. The rising sun looked like an atom bomb had been detonated in the\ndistance.\n\nCows kept us company on the walk towards the old castle-fort city of Mansilla de\nlas Mulas. As per usual nothing was open and our pace didn't falter as we\nwalked through the city. Several groups of students spilled out of the Albergue\nand onto the streets, laughing, dressed in relaxing clothes. At first we were\nimpressed that they would agree to do something like this at such an early age,\nbut then we saw them loading their bags into a van.\n\nThe sun was not cooperating as I tried to take a picture of the castle walls on\nthe way out. Around that time a bird decided to poop on my shirt, and I was\nforced to wear it as a badge of shame for the rest of the day. It was chocolate\nfor anyone who asked.\n\nFinally, the hills have returned to us. Small ones, sure, but at least I could\nno longer see for miles on end. The bigger ones were still further ahead.\n\nWhat could possibly be over this hill? Nothing, just more towns.\n\nWe took breakfast at a random bar in the city before Villarente at Villarmoros.\nIt was tucked away from the highway in the towns’ square, and the plaza was\ncovered in white and yellow polka-dots. Probably one of the stranger towns I've\nseen so far, but they had fresh Spanish tortilla and bocadillos! I splurged and\nbought both.\n\nVillarente and Arcahuega stood no chance as we powered through them, covering\nthe 12 kilometers in a few hours. Most of the path took us along highways, and\nthrough the busy downtown areas. Sometimes it would switch it up and take us\nunder bridges, or down along a river.\n\nThey were doing construction on part of the path, so we had to take a different\nroute for entering León. The uphill battle was worse than I expected. It was on\npaved road for the most part, but finally as we got near the top it diverted\ninto the woods, and oh what a sight it was after we cleared the trees.\n\nWe raced down the dirt path that took us onto a county road. Here we followed\nthe markers as they led us through the rugged and increasingly modern areas of\nthe city. I like the transition from modern to old, especially when the old\ntown your entering has a wall around it.\n\nThe Benedictine church where we wanted to spend the night was hard to find. We\nmust have asked at least three different people where it was, and walked an\nextra two kilometers around the city, but finally we found it. Crissi and I\nwalked around looking for food, and found a bar that served \"rustic bread\".\nBasically it was large slices of various breads with toppings on them, but they\nwere super delicious. We returned to the Albergue to meet up with Bianca, and\nthen took her to the same bar, just because we liked it so much.\n\nAfter drinking and eating we explored the city, with me playing the tour guide.\nFirst stop was the cathedral, of course. Two pilgrims where walking in at the\nsame time, and we convinced them to join us in order to get the ticket discount\ndeal for a group. This was a true gothic cathedral: it was large and grand on\nthe inside with the columns drawing your eyes up, up, and up.\n\nNext we went to a basilica, then a house designed by Gaudi, and finally the city\npark.\n\nOn the way back we found a bar to grab some beers and people watched for a\nwhile. Ciro, limping, found us on the way back to the church. He had to buy\nsome new shoes because his current pair had taken off most of his toenails!\nYeah, that's a real thing that can happen if you walk for extended periods of\ntime.\n\nDinner was a pilgrims menu at the restaurant next to the the church, which gives\ndiscounts for those staying there.\n\nThere's now only two weeks left before reaching Santiago! Nights spent in places\nlike Logroño, or Nájera, feel like they were ages ago, and yet also felt like\nthey were only yesterday.\n\nI am thankful that today was a relatively easy walk, with plenty of places to\nstop and eat, or to get water. I have no idea what tomorrow holds, partly\nbecause we don't know which way to go (there are two routes), and we don't know\nhow far we're going to make it.\n\n";
