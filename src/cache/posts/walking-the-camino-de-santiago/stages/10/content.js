Maybe I was anxious to begin,\nmaybe the others were sleeping in, or maybe I looked at the weather forecast\nand saw the heavy rain in the afternoon.\n\nToday's stage was meant to be a short one, and I could have easily slept in. The\nsun was already up and hiding behind the clouds as I walked out of the city and\ninto the fields.\n\nGreen farm fields, similar to the scenery from the first half of yesterdays\nwalk, surrounded me so I kept my head down and focused on the steps, trying to\nignore the pain in my feet. I'm still secretly hoping that the problem with my\nknee will get better on its own.\n\nI passed through Granon without stopping, and continued on to Redecilla del\nCamino. Without even realizing it, I had passed out of Basque territory and\ninto the Castilla y Leon region. This would end up being the widest region on\nthe Camino.\n\nAfter filling up on water, and taking a quick break, I went back out on to\ntrail. The next town was Castildelgato, and the only thing that caught my eye\nthere was an old gate, standing guard over a field of grass. I wonder what used\nto be there, oh so long ago, and what that gate protected.\n\nViloria de Rioja was the next town after Castildelgato. A pilgrim whom I had\nseen in Santo carrying a MacBook (of all things) with them was just up ahead,\nand we chatted for a little bit as we arrived at Viloria. They were using a\nporter service so they only had to walk with a backpack during the day, hence\nwhy they were able to carry something weighing a few pounds.\n\nWe stopped at the open Albergue in town, and they were serving breakfast. I was\ntempted to buy an omelette, but the place gave me a weird vibe, so I used the\nfacilities and kept going. The other pilgrim stayed behind and hung out for a\nlittle bit, but I was in one of my \"gotta get there gotta get going\" moods.\n\nBut I was happy with my decision because as soon as I took the paved road out of\ntown, the blue sky returned along with green hills and fields in the distance.\nThey cultivated the entire surface of these hills, going all the way to the\ntop. It made me nearly miss a step: another view of nothing but green fields\nand blue skies. I am loving this Camino, even with all of the pain that it\nbrings.\n\nI stole myself away from the surrounding landscape, and thirty minutes later I\nwas arriving in Villamayor del Rio. I pulled out some peanuts that I had picked\nup in Santo that morning and, having spotted the darkening clouds ahead of me,\ntook out the rain jacket and bag cover. I decided to forego the poncho, and I\nwould come to regret that decision. I stuffed the peanuts in my pocket, threw\non the backpack, and hit the road.\n\nNot a minute had gone by before the first raindrop fell on me. I was so proud of\nmy decision to put on the rain gear. This weather wasn't going to catch me off\nguard. I snapped some pictures of the trail before putting my phone away and\ngetting ready to go into heads down mode. That was the last picture I would\ntake on todays walk.\n\nI smelled the rain before I saw it. I could hear the whooshing sound as it raced\nover the ground, disturbing the air ahead of it. Those first few raindrops were\nan early warning, and I did not listen to them.\n\nIt had begun to rain, and I mean really rain. Straight up downpour. It rained a\nwhole heck of a lot harder than I thought it would, and my entire lower half\ngot soaked. The rain even started to penetrate my rain coat! Luckily the stuff\nin my bag stayed dry.\n\nWith heavy wet shoes I entered Belorado an hour later, probably carrying enough\nrain water to fill a small bottle.\n\nThe Municipal Albergue wasn't open yet when I arrived (after all, it was only\n11:30 am), so I hung out with the other rain soaked Pilgrims as we waited for\nthem to finish cleaning.\n\nNow that the rain was done, I set out to explore the village in order to kill\nsome time before dinner. My exploring was short lived because I was starving. I\ngrabbed lunch at a small restaurant above a bar in the town square that\napparently hated natural light (there weren't any windows). The Paella and wine\nwere really good though, and they had the world cup on the TV.\n\nI headed back to the Albergue after getting some supplies to take a nap, and saw\nthat I had a bunk mate, and that they were using my outlet extension cord! Her\nname was Crissi (USA). I was so happy that someone was actually able to use it,\nand she commended me on the genius of bringing it.\n\nAfter waking up I still had more time to kill before dinner. Damn these early\narrival times! I went back out to do more exploring, and ran into Crissi near a\nruined church. We checked out the church, walked around, and hiked up to the\ncastle ruins at the top of a hill next to town.\n\nI loved the view of the city from up here, and took out my phone to take a\npicture. As I took a step forward to get the shot, I nearly slipped off the\nside of the hill! That would have been a bad way to end the Camino.\n\nWe ended up ordering dinner at the Albergue (the food was delicious), and met a\nlot of great people. Two of them were from Texas: Lauren and Hailey. They\nquickly became known as \"The Texans\".\n\nThis day started out with my head focused on the ground, alone, and soaking wet,\nbut ended with new friends and great conversation. And I was looking forward to\nwalking with them the next day. The destination is 30 kilometers away called\nAges (pronounced ah-guess, kind of like August), and tomorrows forecast had\nzero rain in the afternoon.\n\n";
