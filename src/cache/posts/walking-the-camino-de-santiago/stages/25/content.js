Myself and a couple\nothers from our group left together in the darkness. The fog was so dense and\nthick that our headlamps could barely illuminate the way directly in front of\nus.\n\nIt was a little creepy hiking through the forest with the fog and trees. We\nstopped by a statue dedicated to the pilgrims at the top of another mountain,\nit was an eerie sight seeing it rise out of the darkness. Two more towns came\nand went in the darkness: Hospital de la Condesa and Padornelo. No lights were\non, too early for them. Passing cars reminded us where the road was.\n\nAs the sun rose the clouds ahead of us became light gray at first, then bright\nwhite, and finally pinks followed. The clouds behind us burned as if they were\non fire. We made it to Alto do Poio for rest and food. They had a super huge\ndog that begged us for attention, which I obliged. It laid its massive paw on\nmy arm until I fed it some table scraps, or at least I would have if the owner\nhadn't called it away.\n\nCrissi and Mauro fell into deep conversation and I fell behind as I stopped to\ntake pictures of the cloud subversion. I saw some of the most beautiful trees,\nstones, moss and fog landscapes as I descended alone down the mountain.\n\nAmazingly we arrived at Triacastela before noon! Sadly, the three castles here\nare no more. While we ate breakfast we collectively decided to keep\ngoing since there wasn't really anything of interest in this town, and we would\nhave gone crazy staying here having arrived so early in the day. Luckily the\nothers in our group behind us felt the same seeing as they ended up in Sarria\nas well.\n\nDuring our breakfast we befriended Eileen from New Zealand, whom spoke near\nperfect Spansih (even Crissi was impressed), and she walked the rest of the way\nwith us down the mountain. Crissi and Mauro were flying down the second\nmountain, I couldn't believe how fast they were going. I tried my best to keep\nup. But halfway down I pulled something, and ended up inflaming a tendon in my\nankle.\n\nLuis met up with us at some point as we began the walk in to Sarria. I used my\ntrekking poles as makeshift crutches and hobbled the rest of the way. Before we\nascended the stairs into the city, we stopped for a compression sock and pain\ncream at the pharmacy for my tendon. Big thanks to Crissi for translating and\nhelping to explain what was wrong.\n\nWe found a cute Alburgue a stretch of the main road around 5pm, and felt\nrelieved to have a nice place to spend the night. The showers even had privacy!\nWe made another family dinner while watching the Nigeria and Argentina soccer\ngame.\n\nSarria is the starting point for those who can only take a week of vacation off\nto do the Camino, which means it's not much farther now.\n\n";
