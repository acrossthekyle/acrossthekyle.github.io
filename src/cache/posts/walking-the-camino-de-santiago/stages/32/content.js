It was a truly magical experience arriving at the 0 km\nmarker with the sun coming out from behind the clouds. I sat and reflected for\nnearly an hour on the rocks staring out at the ocean.\n\nOh my God, the sunrise this morning was so epic. In fact, the whole morning hike\nout of Olveiroa to Hospital (so many towns on the Camino with this name) was\namazing. Breakfast today was served up at a cute cafe in Hospital.  We took a\ngood long break here.\n\nShortly after leaving, we came to a decision. To the left: Fisterra, and to the\nright: Muxia. I know where I was going, so it was a no brainer. Mauro had to\ndecide which way he wanted to go since he had less time than us to finish. He\nended up deciding to come with us.\n\nNo more towns for a while, back to hiking through the wilderness. As we gained\nground, and made our way up the hill, we were able to grab our first views of\nthe ocean, and our destination at Cee / Corcubión. A couple of hours later the\nmist returned to us. We also picked up a new walking companion halfway through:\nAnna from Hungary.\n\nThere it is, our first glimpse of the ocean! We walked through Cee and headed for\nCorcubión. The walk around the bay was pleasant, even if we did get lost halfway\nthrough and had to make our own alternative Camino to get back on track. Lunch\nwas served via sandwiches from yesterday on the waters edge. We were not looking\nforward to this next part. It was time to say goodbye, for the last time, again.\nWe had reached our stage ender for the day, but the others needed to keep going.\n\nWe walked with them to the towns edge before the path turned away from a low\nstone wall and up into the hills once more. We said goodbye, and watched them\ndisappear into the trees. As Crissi and I walked back into town to find a place\nto stay something came over us, something clicked in our minds. Crissi and I\nlooked at eachother at the exact same moment , and we said it at the same\ntime: we should keep going and catch up with them. We returned to the spot\nwhere we had said our goodbyes and continued walking.\n\nIt only took us about an hour of walking before we came to the town of Estorde\nand wanted to explore this amazing beach off to our left. It looked like private\nproperty, and was set behind a fancy hotel. As soon as we got onto the sand, we\nsaw a figure walking in the distance along the waters edge. I recognized the\nuniquely brown sweater that they were wearing, but I didn't want to get my\nhopes up. Sure enough, it was Anna!\n\nWe rested here for no good reason, other than to get coffee, pop, and enjoy the\nbeach at the hotels restaruant. An hour later we would have our first views of\nFisterra. Seeing it from The Way for the first time was amazing. We didn't waste\nany time walking along this stretch of water-front trail in order to get to\ntown and to the end.\n\nAs we arrived in to town, and began to the walk to The Lighthouse, the sun came\nout of hiding and brightened the world around us. It was perfect timing. It was\na truly magical experience arriving at the 0 km marker. Here it was, the\nofficial end of the Camino. I was overcome with emotion, and the\nlocals/visitors let us take our time taking pictures at it.\n\nWe walked up to and around The Lighthouse. Behind it a cliff dropped away to the\nocean far, far, below. Along the way down were several rocks and places to sit.\nWe all claimed a spot, and just sat there in the silence, staring at the ocean. I\nmust have sat there for nearly an hour on the rocks. I reflected upon everything\nthat had brought me to this point. I also let my mind go blank and just stare\nin awe and wonder.\n\nThis was it. The end. The true end. The end of the world.\n\nMauro had found us while we were on the rocks, and needless to say he was happy\nto see us again. We left the ocean around 5:30 pm and started to walk back in\nto town. Places would be filling up fast. The municipal Albergue was already\nfull, so we kept checking out other places. Each and every one was full.\n\nBefore we parted ways after re-entering town, Anna had told us about this\nHungarian Albergue that she booked a room at. Out of options, we went there.\nThey had beds available, and ended up putting us in the same room as her.\n\nAt some point we found Cerstin, I can't remember when or how, but she was there!\n\nWe grabbed dinner with the Texans around 7pm at a fish restaurant, and then\nheaded for the “hippy” beach that our Albergue host had told us about. It was a\ngreat time hanging out in the water and walking along the beach with\neveryone. We saw dolphins in the ocean!\n\nWords cannot express what this journey has meant to me. I can tell you about\nthe friends, places, and pain, but you can never truly fully know it unless\nyou go and experience it for yourself.\n\nWe said our real, truthful, final goodbyes to everyone on the morning of July\n5th at the bus stop in Fisterra. They took the earlier buses back to Santiago,\nthen on to the airport, and their flights back to their homes. I'm thankful to\nhave been able to meet so many amazing human beings.\n\nCrissi and I checked out of the Hungarian Albergue. We walked along the beach\nfor a couple of hours, collecting numerous sea shells, and then headed for the\nbus back to Santiago.\n\nWe spent our final day together walking around the city, seeing the pilgrim\nmuseum, going back to the same place for dinner that we had been to when we\npreviously came here, and seeing some other landmarks that we had missed the\nfirst time. We also went clothes/gift shopping for ourselves.\n\nAt night we returned to the plaza, and sat there for nearly an hour staring at the\nplace as the sun set. This was the place we had dreamt of reaching, and had\nfinally arrived at. This was our last chance to say goodbye to the Cathedral.\nWe returned to our place to finish packing up, and to go to bed.\n\nBack in Belorado, Crissi had left early in the morning before I woke up without\nsaying goodbye. Now, as fate would have it, it's the same again. She had to\nleave earlier than me in order to catch a train to Madrid, before I would be\nwaking to walk to the bus for the airport. We said goodbye at night, one final\nhug, an expression of thanks, and promised to see each other back in the states.\n\nI probably wouldn't be seeing my closest Camino friend/family again, at least\nnot for a long time, and I was very sad. On the morning of July 7th, 2018 I\npacked up my bag for the last time, left the Albergue alone and in the dark,\nboarded a bus, and headed for the airport for my return back to America.\n\nI'll see you again someday St. James.\n\n";
