Not a soul in\nsight with the air calm and peaceful in the old city I set out before the\nothers to explore parts that I wasn't able to see yesterday. The only people in\nthe streets were other pilgrims walking in the opposite direction as they left\nthe city for the next stage.\n\nIt didn't take me long to find a route leading way away from the square, and\ntowards the other areas of the city. While the square in the morning was calm\nand peaceful, the area outside of the urban center were bustling with\nactivity.\n\nThere wasn't much to see beyond the architecture of the buildings, and the\nvarious parks. You couldn't even get inside the arena where the release the\nbulls. Slightly disappointed, I hurried back to the Albergue.\n\nLeaving the city took less time than entering it. The residents were starting to\nstir, and the street cleaners were mopping up the mess from the previous\nnight.\n\nAfter zigzagging through a series of small and large parks we found ourselves\nonce again walking through the countryside of Spain with the city growing\nsmaller and smaller with each glance backwards.\n\nNothing but green fields were laid out in front of us, with clouds sticking to\nthe ground, their fingers clawing at the hills in the distance trying to pull\nthemselves closer to the earth.\n\nRainbows appeared at every edge of a leading cloud formation. Luckily the rain\nstayed away from us, and their dark gray color was merely for show.\n\nLarge and narrow gravel paths filled with potholes of water snaked their way\nacross the fields, through small forests, and over small rivers. Gradually The\nWay began to rise higher and higher leading towards Zariquiegui: the last stop\nbefore crossing over Alto de Perdon, and the windy mountain crossing.\n\nI caught up with Tania's group (Shelby, Alex, and Tania) in Zariquiegui. They\nwere getting ready to head out as I arrived. Jokingly I said that I'd see them\nat the next rest stop since that was where we kept running into each other. The\nother friends from my group slowly trickled in and dropped their bags at the\ncafe.\n\nAfter recharging we slowly left for the top of the mountain. On the way up we\nkept leap frogging each other when those in front slowed down, or took\npictures, and the others from behind kept going.\n\nThe views from the top did not disappoint, and it was the windiest spot so far\non the Camino with views of the countryside extending away in all directions.\n\nThe way down though was hard, and slow going.\n\nAfter reaching flat ground again, I suddenly found myself very much alone. I\ndon’t know how it started, but I was talking to myself. To be perfectly honest\nwith you, I have never done anything like this before. All sorts of random\nthings started popping into my brain, and coming out of my mouth.\n\nI stopped paying attention to the ground I was walking on, or to the world\naround me. I just walked and talked, walked and talked.\n\nEverything from the real reason why I’m here doing the Camino, why I do the\nthings I do, realizing that I hated my job, what brought me happiness, and what\nleft me empty and wanting more.\n\nIt was an amazing feeling to shine light onto things that were hiding in the\nshadows, and things that I didn’t even know I was thinking. I felt so great\nabout airing out my thoughts and feelings.\n\nAt some point I met up with the others in the outskirts of Urtega. We grabbed\nlunch at a small Albergue in town for about an hour, and relaxed in the sun.\n\nAfter leaving Urtega we spread out again as we walked through Obanos on our way\nto Puente la Reina.\n\nAn attractive looking Albergue at the edge of town as we got off of the Camino\nbeckoned to us. It took some debating, but we ended up staying at Albergue\nReparadores further in to town. It is one of the oldest Albergues on the\nCamino (hundreds of years). Some of us from our group cooked a dinner, and the\nothers shared what they had to give.\n\nOverall this wasn’t a bad day in terms of terrain or distance, but this was the\nfirst time that I had done any sort of back-to-back, day-in-day-out, walking\nand my feet were feeling it. Hopefully tomorrow will be flat ground on the way\nto Estella.\n\n";
