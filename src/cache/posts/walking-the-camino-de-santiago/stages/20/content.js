The\nbreeze coming through the open windows shifted from warm to cold, and rumblings\nin the distance confirmed it: the rain had arrived. With much reluctance I shut\nthe window closest to my bed, I knew it was going to get stuffy in here really\nquickly with it closed.\n\nThe rain helped to mute the sound of those in the room who were snoring, and I\nfell back to sleep. We agreed to wake early again today because of the ever\npresent heat, and a few hours later I was up.\n\nThe floor in the inner part of the building was exposed to the sky, and it was\ncovered in a minefield of water puddles. I got my stuff ready in the dining\nroom where we shared dinner the previous night. Crissi was eager to get going,\nand she departed before the rest of us.\n\nWith darkness enveloping the small village, and the street lights carving out\norange cones of light, I turned on my head torch and headed out of town. The\nway out was easy to find thanks to it being a straight paved road shooting off\ninto the distance.\n\nMore heads down walking along the road while avoiding the occasional car.\n\nThe sun started to ignite the sky as it struggled to break out from the thick\nclouds that concealed it near the horizon. Forty minutes later it broke free,\nand illuminated the world around me.\n\nI walked through endless farmlands as the road approached a T-junction in the\ndistance. Flies and snails were out in force this morning, taking up the entire\npath both on the ground and in the air.\n\nHere the path veered off to the left after crossing the junction, and then took\na sharp right, as it turned into a wide mud-filled dirt trail. More farmlands\nsurrounded me as I zig-zagged my way along, avoiding the puddles of water.\n\nOn a few occasions I spotted Crissi's shoe print in the mud, and knew that I\nmustn't be too far behind her. After a while the path veered off to the right\nthrough stacks of earth and hay, as the first town on todays trek, Villabente,\nappeared. I saw nothing of interest in the town, and kept going via a winding\nroute that went through the city's center, and passed some lumber warehouses\nbefore arriving on the dirt path once more. Train tracks ahead forced a 90\ndegree turn to the right.\n\nAs I followed alongside the tracks, I quickened my pace in hopes of reaching\nCrissi in the next, larger, town called Hospital de Orbigo. But a faster pace\nmeant that I couldn't be as nimble as I would have preferred when it came to\navoiding the massive legions of white-shelled snails that were occupying the\nwhite gravel path. I tried my best, but I know I probably stepped on several of\nthem. A large stone arrow in the middle of the path told me that I was still\ngoing in the proper direction.\n\nHospital de Orbigo's entrance deliberately went around all sides of an\nindustrial site before having to run across a busy street in order to continue\non the path on other side of a roundabout.\n\nThe yellow arrows, and curvy road art, led me to Bar El Puente. It had a garden\nfull of colorful small birds. With no breakfast to be had, I bought a banana\nand an apple before heading for the bridge.\n\nThe bridge was the site of a legendary medieval jousting competition. There’s a\nhuge backstory to it, and you should read about it, but the bridge itself is\ncalled El Paso Honroso (The Honorable Pass).\n\nI decided to skip breakfast here since the only offerings were at expensive\nrestaurants, and it ended up being a good decision because on my way out of\ntown I ran in to Crissi. She was debating taking the road route along the\nhighway (nay), or the scenic route through the hills and trees (yay). I \"made\"\nher choose the scenic route.\n\nThe next town at Villares de Orbigo had an open cafe, and the food was so cheap\nthat both Crissi and I got some food. A minor uphill gravel path took us to the\nwidest red dirt path that I've ever seen. We took this down, around, and over\nanother highway.\n\nA few more kilometers and we were entering Santibanez de Valdeiglesias. Bianca\nrandomly spotted us at the top of the road as we were leaving and called us\nover. As we waited for her to pack up, we randomly ran into Mauro at an\nAlbergue! He was just getting started on this day, so he promised to catch up.\n\nWe marched along the red dirt paths through various forests, up and over hills,\nand over large rocks, and I spotted several large and odd looking bugs. The\npictures above don't do the scenery justice though. Even though it was very\nred, it was very beautiful.\n\nA couple hours later and we arrived at a trail angel stop known as Casa de Los\nDioses. It was a free food and drink place, with plenty of cushioned seats in\nthe shade. We even got to sign our names onto the side of the house. And the\nhost was quite a character himself.\n\nAnother thirty minutes would pass before getting our first views of Astorga at\nthe cross on the hill overlooking the city. We passed through San Justo de la\nVega and continued to follow the road for a while until we came to bright white\ngravel path. It rain alongside the backs of several warehouse buildings.\n\nThe only shade was a thin sliver next to the buildings. After a turn in the path\nwe came to giant green ramp structure that would take us up and over some train\ntracks. Initially this made me mad because we had just done all of that\nwalking, and then to have to go up and down several ramps just to get over some\ntrain tracks. We followed the road again, sticking to the narrow sidewalks\nwhere we could, pass a roundabout and up a steep ramp towards the old part of\nthe city.\n\nThere was an Albergue at the top of this ramp, right inside the city, but we\ninitially ignored it because I thought it looked like a hospital. After a few\nmore moments we decided to turn around and head to the place. It ended up being\na good place, especially at five euros. It had great views of the surrounding\ncountryside thanks to our rooms being on the top floor.\n\nThe nicety of the amenities stopped there.\n\nThere were zero outlets near the beds, the showers were so hot they nearly\nscalded my skin, they made us stay on the top floor because “we are young”, the\nbathroom toilet stalls were super tiny and I could barely move in them, and\nfinally there is no air circulation.\n\nBut it was only five euros, so I took it in stride.\n\nWe grabbed much needed beers and food at a local bar. I did some more gear\nrepacking, got rid of stuff that I just didn’t need, and was able to get rid of\nmy first aid kit plastic bag! But somehow my bag still feels way to full.\n\nAfter repacking, I suddenly became very aware of the pain in my knee\n(especially after going up and down five flights of stairs several times). I\nwent to the pharmacy and got a brace for my knee, along with some cream for my\nfinger (which somehow got an infection near the finger nail). The knee brace\nfeels great when going downhill, and down stairs. I should have gotten this\nearlier.\n\nI met up with Cerstin near the cathedral and we took a quick walk around town.\nWe decided to not go inside the cathedral, or do the touristy tours. It looked\nlike every other church after we stuck our heads inside for a quick peek.\n\nCerstin invited me to dinner with her, another German pilgrim, and a\nmother-daughter duo from Europe. They were making pancakes for dinner, and we\nhad “real” German beer called Kriek with it. The food and the beer were both\nreally good. I felt ashamed for having not helped prepare any of it.\n\nThe weather is gearing up for another storm, and the rain blew through without\nmuch warning. All of the clothes hanging outside got soaked. It's still hot and\nstuffy in our room, even after that torrent of wind and rain. Looks like it'll\nbe another night of no clothes. But I'm excited, because tomorrow we are\nofficially returning to the mountains.\n\n";
