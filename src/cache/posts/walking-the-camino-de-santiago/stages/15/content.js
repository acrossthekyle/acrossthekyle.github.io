After yesterdays blazingly fast speed it will be a\nrelief to walk at a more calm and steady pace. But soon after passing through\nPoblacion de Campos Maddy had to stop and take it easy for a while. She urged\nme to keep going, and promised to catch up.\n\nThe trail markers stood like guardians on the path at each road crossing, and it\nfelt like entering a gate when passing through them. Todays trail hugged the\nnewly built road between the cities of Fromista and Carrion.\n\nWith the sun was rising behind me I marched along the gravel path, passing each\nkilometer marker at a steady pace. With each passing marker I was getting more\nand more annoyed. It wasn't fun being constantly reminded of how far I had to\ngo. I liked not knowing the incremental distance and just pushing on to the end\nof the stage for the day.\n\nVillarmentero de Campos offered the first chance for food. The only place that\nlooked like it had food was at a bar with scarecrows and mannequins arranged in\nthe yard. The hostess also seemed a bit off, so I inhaled the croissant and\nbanana, used the bathroom, and quickly returned to the road and the ever\npresent kilometer markers.\n\nThis would be the only pitstop before arriving at Carrion.\n\nIn Villalcazar de Sirga I took the detour through the town center, and passed by\nthe church. Supposedly it was the last one built by the Templars? After\nVillalcazar I would pause every so often and turn around, hoping to spot Maddy\nbehind me, but no dots appeared on the horizon.\n\nThe final walk in to Carrion seemed to take forever thanks to the unchanging\nscenery, but at 10am I walked into the town square. Bar Carmen was the first\nplace I spotted that looked halfway decent, and grabbed some breakfast while\nwaiting for the others to arrive. My Spanish definitely needs some practice:\nthe bartender had a hard time understanding me, but we got through it\ntogether.\n\nAfter eating I took a tour of the side streets and did some shopping. I needed\nto get a new money belt, and sun glasses, as both had been destroyed earlier in\nthe day. Luckily there was a hiking gear shop that had a good money belt. The\nsunglasses were bought in some bazaar style shop that sold one of everything,\nbut you can't go wrong for six euros.\n\nTwo hours later Crissi and Bianca texted me to say that they found some beds at\nan old monastery called Monestario de Santa Clara. It was finally time to\nabandon my post at the bar, and I'm sure the owner was happy to see me go. The\nplace we're staying at doesn't have any Wi-Fi, but we’re cooking dinner again!\nWe did some shopping and then headed back to the monastery and hung out in the\ncourtyard. We got pretty tipsy from the wine we bought, and snacked on some\nmeats, cheeses, and grapes.\n\nI also bought my first souvenir of the trip: a small pin in the shape of a\nyellow arrow, which is one of the main symbols on the Camino.\n\nWhile the sun was high in the sky, and the temps were approaching the upper\n90’s, Crissi and I did some exploring of the parks near the river. Before\ndinner we all checked out a lovely Spanish guitar performance at the local\nchurch.\n\nCiro from Hontanas cooked us dinner and oh my God it was freaking delicious, and\nfilling. I probably won't have to eat for another three days. It's a shame we\ncouldn't save the leftovers and take them with us. Crissi and I did the dishes\nwhile singing along to 1985 and Wannabe by the Spice Girls. It was quite the\nperformance.\n\nTomorrow we are crossing The Wasteland with 18 kilometers of nothing, literally.\nThe Meseta would be unbearable if it weren’t for the beautiful cities dotting\nits landscape, and the people you meet.\n\n";
