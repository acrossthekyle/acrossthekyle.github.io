I can't believe that it's almost over: three more\ndays and we're in Santiago. Today we had to say goodbye to our group.\n\nLouis marched on and did two stages in one day, Maddy Cerstin and Isabelle\ntook it easy and stayed at the end of the previous stage, Mauro and Eileen\ncontinued on to Gonzar, and Crissi and I stayed in Pontemarion.\n\nI knew to expect this from my research of the Camino, but after experiencing it\nfirst-hand I couldn't handle the feelings. To become so intimate with people\nwhom you swear with, suffer with, laugh with, and make memories with. It's\nsomething that I've never truly experienced before. I want to go back in time\nand do the whole thing over again...\n\nI can actually see myself doing this again.\n\nAs far as today is concerned, it wasn't too hard of a walk. I took it easy\ntoday due to my right ankle tendon issues. It didn't cause any major problems\nthough thanks to the compression sock, which Crissi says is really just a\nstocking.\n\nWe crossed another small mountain on our way out of Sarria. The various forests\nand small towns that we went through today seemed to pass by in a blur. We\nstopped for breakfast at a cafe in a small town outside of Morgade. Shortly\nthereafter it was upon us: the 100 kilometer marker.\n\nPontemarion was there, ahead of us, a short distance away. We decided to take\nthe not-so-dangerous approach in to the city. The more dangerous approach went\ndown old dirt and brick steps, and the sign warned against doing it only if you\nwere in absolute great shape, which of course I was not.\n\nWhile eating lunch on the main street Crissi and I ended up deciding to stay in\nPontemarion, while Eileen and Mauro would continue on. As soon as they were\ngone, we convinced ourselves that this was a good decision. As soon as we were\nsettled in though, and relaxing at a bar, we realized that we had made a\nmistake. We missed them already.\n\nDuring dinner Crissi and I thought about trying to take a two day trip to\nPorto, Portugal in order to use up the extra days we'd have since we have been\ncrushing these stages with a passion and figured everyone would be too far\nahead or behind us to see them again.\n\nEither way, we will be celebrating the Fourth of July from Fisterra, Spain.\n\n";
