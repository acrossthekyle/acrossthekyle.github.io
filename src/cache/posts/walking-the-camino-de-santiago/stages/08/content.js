Our expectation that a cafe would\nalways be open early in the morning for food was slowly becoming unreliable.\nLogrono left us high and hungry as we took our leave of the city.\n\nOn unsteady legs we walked through the city parks along the bike path. Every\nstore or cafe in the distance was a chance for food, but none were open. Not\neven the supermarket at the end of the trail seemed alive. The underpass and\nopen country ahead signaled a goodbye to any hope of finding food before the\nnext city 13 kilometers away.\n\nThe sky was a deep blue, and the clouds were a mixture of soft gray and white.\nTall trees and poppy fields stole the attention away from food, but not for\nlong. A large park was fast approaching, and scouts were sent in each direction\nto find food but they came back empty handed each time.\n\nUphill, around a bend, and then a sight that will make you stop in your tracks:\na shimmering lake surrounded by dark hills, still hidden from the sun, with\nthat deep blue sky above it. Seeing such a beautiful thing so early in the\nmorning clears your mind.\n\nJust up ahead, at the corner of the lake, stood another seemingly empty park and\nwe had to steal our eyes away from the lake as we returned to the trees.\n\nBut ahead there were signs for food. A cafe on the waters edge? An open cafe? A\nplace with bathrooms, water, and food! We dropped our packs and got in line as\nthe owner was opening up.\n\nAs we sat at the plastic tables staring at the lake, savoring the food we had\nbeen so fortunate to discover, a family of Swans came up from the waters edge.\nWe had to work hard to pull ourselves up from these seats, and this view.\n\nFull stomachs, warmed hearts, and blood caffeinated. We're ready for the day\nnow.\n\nAn hour later we came across an old man selling his wares, and handing out\nstamps. His name was Marcelo Lobato, and we found out that he is a walking\nlegend. This man has walked nearly 5,000 miles across Europe.\n\nThe highway kept us company for another few kilometers, and then we were able to\nturn away from it and head back into farmland. After another 8 km of hard\nwalking and climbing we came to Navarette: another circular city built on a\nhill.\n\nAn old pilgrim hospital lay in ruins as we took the road towards the hill. We\nweaved our way through the streets, heading for the church and our next break.\nThese people spared no expense when they built these churches several hundred\nyears ago. The alter was covered in gold with several dozen saints and idols in\nit. I don't think I'll ever tire of these amazing structures built so long\nago.\n\nWe left for what would become the longest chunk of walking yet at nearly 16 km.\nMost of the landscape was farms, with the usual ups and downs, and nothing to\nstare at but the land in the distance and watching those white downs on the\nhorizon grow into white mounds, and those white mounds to grow into buildings.\n\nIn Ventosa we decided as a group to not stop, and instead to push for Nájera in\norder to knock it out all at once.\n\nMore unending farmland with the occasional pocket of trees. After Ventosa all we\ncould see in the distance were two white mounds that were slowly growing, but\nyet were still so far away. It's hard to gauge how far away an object is\nsometimes.\n\nThe brown dirt path took us next to highways, through small towns, and passed\nindustrial sites.\n\nAnd that was when it happened, on the last hill before heading down into Nájera.\nEverything from my hips to my feet were in pain. I was struggling to take each\nstep, and my feet just wanted to quit.\n\nI had been listening to music for a while now to help me get through these long\nkilometers. Upon arrival at the summit overlooking the last leg of the journey\ntoday, the song Believer by American Authors started playing.\n\n“I’m a believer that things will get better”.\n\nThese lyrics started to play as soon as I hit the summit and saw our destination\nin the distance. It hit me like a ton of bricks.\n\nThe pain will get better, the stress will get better, the hardship of walking\nwill get better, the beauty of this land will get better, and the struggles in\nlife will get better.\n\nAll of this hit me at once, and it was an overwhelming feeling. I winced with\npain, nearly crying at points, as Tania and I entered the city of Nájera. We\nhad become separated from the others during the last stretch.\n\nWe walked for what seemed like ages to find a place to stay. After following a\ngroup of Spaniards we eventually arrived at Las Pena near the edge of the city.\nI could give two shits about the place, it was a bed and a shower.\n\nThe rivers edge and the bright sun called to us. We headed there for lunch and\ndrinks. After basking in the sun, and spilling wine on my pants, we returned to\nour beds for a much needed nap. I spotted Leon and the others coming up the\nriver walk and heading to the grocery store across the bridge when I went back\nto town a short while later. I followed them and finally got smart about\ngetting some snacks for the next days walk.\n\nThey bought a bottle of wine and some chocolates. We returned to the rivers edge\nand sat in the grass sharing the bottle.\n\nI’m going to meet all kinds of people on the Camino, and they are going to make\nme thankful for having friends to laugh with at the end of the day after\nwalking each stage.\n\nSanto Domingo is our goal for tomorrow, and apparently we'll be walking through\na ghost town in order to get there.\n\n";
