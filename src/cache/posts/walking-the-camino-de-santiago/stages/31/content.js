Day four of rain in the\nmorning, and probably the third day on the entire Camino with a full day of\nrain. As long as my shoes stay dry, I'm a happy camper. The goal for today was\nSanta Mariña, with was about 25 kilometers away. This was because Crissi and I\nwere in no rush to finish since we now knew that we would have time at the end.\n\nOld houses surrounded us as we left, and the low hanging clouds, and misting\nrain, put me in the finest of moods as I walked. The others sped up while\ntalking, and I fell behind once more. I took as many opportunities as possible\nto wander onto peoples property, trying to take good pictures, and talk to the\ndogs. The dogs were unresponsive, and couldn't give two shits about me, but\nthe pictures, I think, turned out well.\n\nSheep greeted me (really they just ignored me and kept eating that grass) as I\ncame to A Peña two hours later. There was a cafe up the stairs, and I found\nMauro and Crissi waiting for me at the bottom of them. Another Pilgrim was\ninside finishing up and about to head back out on the path. I stole\n(more like asked if I could have) his leftover Spanish Tortilla. Nearly half of\nit was left, waiting to be eaten. Suddenly I realized that I would have never\ndone something like this back home, but it felt like a no-brainer since it\nwould go to waste. We have become scavengers.\n\nWe continued on through the rain for another two and a half hours until\narriving in Santa Mariña. After scoping out the places to stay, and getting\nsome cokes, we (more like I) decided that we should keep going. This town felt\nas boring as the last, was a fraction of the size, and the air contained the\nconstant smell of cow feces. This is a smell I will be happy to get away from\nonce we leave the farmlands of Galicia, and will be happy to never have to\nsmell again.\n\nI put in the headphones, turned on shuffle mode, and cranked up the music for\nthe next two hours of rainy walking towards Olveiroa. This time it was me who\npulled ahead and the others fell behind. I don't know when this exactly happened\nbut I realized that they were far behind me when I came to Mallón and decided to\npause and let them catch up. I Grabbed some organce juice at the bar, and sat\noutside waiting. They showed up, separately, 15 minutes later, so they weren't\ntoo far behind me.\n\nBeers were ordered, and we hung out for a short break. The Texans passed us\nagain, said they were heading to Olveiroa. The three of us decided to follow\nthem after our break and knock out the full stage today. We got in to town\naround 3pm. With money on our minds, we checked out the cheaper Albergue but\nit wasn’t that great, so we ended up going to the more expensive one.\n\nI met up with Lauren and Hailey (the Texans) at the restaurant next to the\nAlbergue later in the evening. We played some card games while watching\nfootball. Dinner was so-so, and we didn’t really do much other than hang out\nat the bar watching sports. We're all planning on heading for the ocean towns of\nCee and Corcubòn tomorrow.\n\n";
