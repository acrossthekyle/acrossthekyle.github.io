I attempted to get an early start\nwith everyone else, but that wasn't going to happen. We made it as far as the\ncastle before I realized I had forgotten my food for the day in the fridge of\nthe Albergue, so I had to turn around and go back.\n\nLuckily, we had only made it as far as the castle before I remembered, but\nthis also meant that I would be walking alone today.\n\nThe walk out of the city didn't take too long, and it was mostly along the river.\nAfter a steep uphill climb, and a walk through an old park and past\na church, I was out in the countryside. But this was short live as the next\ntown over came into view. I powered through it simply because it was too early\nfor breakfast, and I knew I had to try and make up for lost time to catch up\nwith my friends.\n\nAs I left the first town behind I snacked on a banana that I had bought the\nprevious day. As I walked along the Calle del Peregrino through the farmlands\nbetween the first town and the next I listened to some music while I ate. Shortly\nthereafter I came upon the next town of Fuentesnuevas. There was nothing of\nnote for me to stop and see here.\n\nOnce more unto the rural space of land between towns. Camponaraya, my next\nport of call on todays journey, had a small juice and cafe stand along the route\nand I stopped for some orange juice, just so I could use the bathroom. I didn't\nneed to buy any food from here as I still had breakfast items from the grocery\nstore yesterday. I sat for about 30 minutes as I enjoyed my orange juice, ate\nanother banana (living the pilgrim life on the cheap isn't very exciting when\nit comes to food), and researched places to stay in the last town of the day.\n\nWith still no sign of any familiar faces, I set off once more. About an hour\nlater I came upon a town called Cacabellos. It had some very interesting\nEgyptian-looking wall art on some of the buildings as I passed. Upon arriving\nI tried to find another \"Green Garden\" spot for some lunch. No such luck. This\nmeant going until the next town of Piero before finding another bathroom, and\nrest.\n\nIn Piero I found a Donativo place to eat my lunch just outside of the city. It\nwas a cute little place that had places to read both inside and out. I got\na KAS \"energy\" drink. I chose a spot near the window so that I could watch the\nroad and wait for Crissi and Maddy while I ate my sandwhich that I had rushed\nback to the Albergue this morning for, but I never saw them. At least the\nsandwich was good!\n\nVillafranca del Bierzo was the next town, and the stage ender for today. I made\nit there in about 90 minutes after leaving Piero. I initially started to take\nthe route that went along the road but then I came across a more scenic route\nwhich diverted a little bit, but was a lot nicer than worrying about cars.\n\nAfter a short descent into the outskirts of the city, I checked out the\nMunicipal Albergue, but it was closed when it should have been open. Instead of\nwaiting around for it to open, and risk losing a bed elsewhere, I decided\nto skip it and go to the next place that I had researched which was Albergue\nLeo. I fell in love with it as soon as I walked in the front door.\n\nI quickly texted those whose phone numbers I had, and they all met up at my\nplace. I was happy to see everyones lovely face again. After getting stuff for\nlunch we went to meet up with Louis at a bar, and hopped to a few different\nplaces before finding a spot for food.\n\nOn the way back to the Albergue we ran into the girls from Texas who we had met\nseveral days earlier in Belorado, and who we have seen here and there on the\nway. They were going back to the river, so we followed them and hung out while\ndoing some swimming, skipping stones, and talking. It was a really good way to\nspend the afternoon in the heat. I think it got up to 100F today.\n\nWe tried to beat the heat and came back to the Albergue to play some cards in\norder to pass the time. We hit the hay early since we were preparing for our\nearliest day yet: leaving before 5am.\n\n";
