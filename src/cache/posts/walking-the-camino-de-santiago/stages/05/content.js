I\nset out earlier than the others to take a short meandering walk through the\nnarrow stone streets of the old city. They took me to the east end of the\nqueen's bridge that led out of town.\n\nThe green-covered hills on the far side stood in contrast to the stone-made\nworld behind me. I turned around after crossing the bridge and took in its\nbeauty.\n\nSome familiar faces called out my name and pulled me back from the trance that\nthe bridge was holding over me. Tania, Shelby, and Alex were just coming across\nthe bridge and heading out. I asked if I could join them on todays walk. They\nwould become my new Camino companions for the next several days.\n\nAutumn-colored fields and hills greeted us as soon as we left the bridge behind.\nHowever relatively flat ground was once again laid out as far as the eye could\nsee after crossing the highway that separated the last of the colorful hills\nfrom the village beyond.\n\nAfter a short detour through this village the landscape was full of mostly\ngently rolling fields of grain, small hills, and patchworks of small farms. A\nlow stone wall bordered the trail on the right as it snaked its way past groves\nof trees.\n\nBreakfast was in a city called Cirauqui on a hill that rose up from the ground\nin the distance. It felt medieval with walls at the base, and roads that went\nin all different directions as they worked their way up from the flat ground to\nthe top.\n\nPoppy fields and a rest spot with a reading area welcomed us as we left the\nhilltop city behind.\n\nWe continued alongside a highway for most of the morning while going under\nbridges, down into small valleys, and passing a cat on a fence trying to find\nits way down. An hour later we passed under a stone bridge crossing and made\nour way into Villatuerta.\n\nAt the Plaza Mayor we let our feet rest, and waited for those who were behind\nus. Once the others arrived, and our bellies had some food in them, we left for\nour destination and place of rest for the night.\n\nA mountain in the distance kept its watchful eye on us as we left town and\nwalked out into empty fields. We took the long way around a lonely small church\nstanding in the middle of these fields as the dirt path slowly resolved into\nthe road to Estella.\n\nOn the outskirts of the city was a massive half-ruined church. I stuck my phone\nthrough the metal gate on the side in order to photograph the smoothly rounded\npillars as they stood in the tall grasses that now covered what was once the\ninterior of this old building.\n\nI rejoined the others near a map of the town on the other side of the road. It\nwas here that we needed to make a choice since we had arrived so early: either\nkeep going until we got tired and found a town to stop at, or stay here in\nEstella. We decided to keep going, but the Albergue looked less than welcoming\nso we turned back.\n\nWe went to the old city, which was hidden behind a stone wall and tightly packed\nhouses. It was much quieter here, away from the hustle and bustle of the fast\nmoving world several hundred feet away. Our beds were on the second floor\nlooking out over the street through balcony doors.\n\nOnce we had settled in, we went to the bar across the street to snack and drink.\nBecause today was a mostly easy one, we had arrived quite early in the\nafternoon, and retreated to our beds shortly afterwards. Down in the streets\nbelow someone was playing the Spanish guitar as we fell asleep for an afternoon\nnap.\n\nThe bar across the street was still open when we woke up. We played card games\n(Shelby taught us Yanev), drank some calimochos, and relaxed by the waters\nedge. Afterwards we found a pizza place for a quick meal. Today was a mostly\nuneventful day, and I can't wait for walks through rolling fields and clear\nblue skies. Hopefully we get to experience these things tomorrow as we make for\nLos Arcos.\n\n";
