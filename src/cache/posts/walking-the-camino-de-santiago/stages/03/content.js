Each stolen glance behind showed a town of white\nand red houses shrinking into the distance, become a multi-colored dot on the\nside of a hill.\n\nNature quickly surrounded us as we left the gravel road, and took the narrow\nstone-paved path higher towards the light falling rain. Shortly soon-after we\nwere made aware that we were in the Basque Country. Poppies lined the trail as\nwe walked past barbed wire fences with donkeys staring in wonder at us, and a\nfew of them posed for pictures.\n\nThe large and fast moving Arga River was on our right as the sun came out. We\napproached our first stop at a cafe on the outskirts of Zuri√°in, along the\nrivers edge.\n\nOver the next hour we walked along highways, passed abandoned buildings, and\nthrough tall grasses. Here we came to a fork in the path: off to the left led\nto Pamplona, and to the right was a small detour which led to Zabaldica at the\ntop of a hill. I chose the detour, while the others chose the main route.\n\nThe small hamlet at the top on this detour contained a 12-century church:\nIglesia de San Esteban, which has one of the oldest church bells in Spain. I\nlit a candle, grabbed some photos from the bell tower, and continued on.\n\nWhile hiking down the dusty path from the church I happened upon a small snack\nstand sitting in the shade of an old farmhouse. I grabbed an apple and left a\nsmall donation.\n\nThere were no other pilgrims walking ahead of, or behind, me as I headed over\nrandom hillside paths, through dark tunnels under highways, and down sloping\ntree-lined roads towards a bridge that led to Trinidad de Arre.\n\nI quickened my pace after realizing that I had not seen my new Camino friends,\nand hoping that I would find them up ahead of me. After walking through the\nempty city streets I spotted them resting at a cafe in a small town square.\n\nThe final route to Pamplona took us through some of the busiest, and shadiest,\nparts of the city. I can't imagine what it must be like to live here and to see\nso many pilgrims backpacking along your streets.\n\nEmpty urban streets gave way to a small park which led to the Magdalena Bridge,\nand the walled city. Ahead of me stood some of the most massive stone walls\nthat I have ever seen. It took us 10 minutes to make our way around the base of\nthese walls and arrive at the drawbridge entrance.\n\nAfter crossing the drawbridge we turned the corner and were met with some of\nthe most colorful buildings. Every single building was a different color\nalternating between pink, blue, green, or yellow. There were town fountains\neverywhere, and the young people hung out in the streets drinking.\n\nWe dropped our stuff off at a nice Albergue because the previous night at Zubiri\nwas too much of a shock, and it was the first one we came across. There was a\nbar down the street called Meson de la Navarreria, and we saddled up there for\nfood and drinks.\n\nI left the bar to check out the church, and ran into Tania from Roncesvalles\ntaking a tour of the city with one of her Camino friends: Alex (USA). We headed\nto the ramparts which look out over the new construction beyond the walls. The\nchurch was empty and dark; not ready for tourists just yet, but eventually I\nwould return later on and check it out. The main square was full of activity\nwith people dining and kids running about.\n\nThe hills, while beautiful, were starting to get to me with all of the\ndescending and I was ready for some flat ground. The day after tomorrow promised\nthat: we would be leaving for the monument to the pilgrims at Alto de Perdon,\nand the city of Puente la Reina.\n\n";
