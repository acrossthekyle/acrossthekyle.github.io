It\nonly takes a matter of minutes, but sometimes it can feel like an eternity.\nWaking up early took little convincing from everyone the night before. We had\ngotten used to rising before dawn. It started out as an excuse for doing most\nof our walking during the hottest parts of the day, but it soon became the\nnatural way of the Camino, at least for our group.\n\nToday we were going to make our way past Cruz de Ferro and the ever growing pile\nof rocks at its base. Why do some consider this pile more important than any\nother pile of rocks along The Way? It’s meant to be a place of casting off your\nburdens. It’s tradition for a person walking the Camino to carry a small rock\nin their pack, and this rock is meant to symbolize any mental or emotional\nburdens you might have.\n\nCruz de Ferro was the first stop of the day at the top of a hill and we arrived\njust as the sun was striking the cross. The others didn’t know about the\ntradition with this cross, so I quickly tossed my stone onto the pile and we\nkept going. I thought I would have felt something, but it didn’t feel as\nemotional as I was expecting, nor did it feel symbolic. It just felt like\ntossing a rock onto a pile of other rocks.\n\nWe had taken the paved road up to the cross but the trail crossed over the top\nand down the backside of the hill, and now we started our slow and awkward\ndescent. The terrain was similar to that of the way from Roncesvalles to Zubiri\nback on day two. I’m glad that I have the knee brace on!\n\nOn the way down we came to the town of Manjarín, where an old man lived who\nclaimed to be the last of the Templars. Whether or not his claim is true, he\nhad some neat looking artifacts hanging from the walls, and his home was rather\nhumble in appearance. Well, it had to be since it was built out of stones and\npartly carved out of the rock.\n\nWe marched under a sunny cloudless sky through rolling green hills that slowly\ntransformed into rocky mountains. Breakfast was in a town called El Acebo. We\nbought breakfast at one place, but decided to eat at the tables in the shade of\nanother. The owner of that second place did not like that since we didn’t buy\nfrom them, and promptly kicked us out. So we sat at the tables in the sun of\nthe place that we had purchased the food from.\n\nAfter another hour and a half of nearly all downhill walking through hills,\nunder bridges, and along streams, we stopped at a town that had a river that\nyou could swim in. The water was ice cold, so I only put my feet in. It was a\nrelaxing break before walking to Ponferrada. Some in our group grabbed beer and\nice cream.\n\nThe walk into Ponderrada took another hour and a half.  Today was the hottest\nit’s been so far I think. We were all dying from the heat, even when we were\ninside buildings. And the Albergue wasn’t much cooler, especially after 5pm.\nThis was going to be a clothes-less night while sleeping, I can feel it\nalready.\n\nWe checked in, picked our beds, did the laundry, and went to the super market to\nget stuff for making dinner. Once all of the chores were done, we decided to\ntake a tour of a restored Templar Castle, which was pretty freaking cool! There\nwasn’t much to see inside of the castle beyond some props set up with plaques\ndescribing life inside the castle, but it was neat being able to freely walk\naround every nook and cranny.\n\nThere was a small cafe just outside the castle where we had a snack. It was too\nhot to do anything else, so we retreated back to the Albergue for some reading,\nchatting, and dinner.\n\n";
