First, buy some liquid deodorant\nwhen you get into town at night, and in the morning when you're about leave take\nit out and shake it vigorously. Keep shaking it until a stray drop finds its way\ninto your eye. Now that you're half-blind, and possibly puffy-eyed, reluctantly\nput on your glasses. Not the best way to start what would become one of the\nlongest days on the camino.\n\nAt 5:30am, bound for the stretch of the Camino that some called The Wasteland,\nwe left Carrion and in no time at all we were walking the ancient Roman route\nknown as the Via Aquitana.\n\nThe green trees in the distance separated the gray world above us from the\nyellow world around us, with the white gravel path never faltering as it shot\nacross the land.\n\nWith very little to see, or do, we kept our heads down and focused on the\nwalking. Luckily the clouds hung around all morning and kept the temperature\ndown. Some folks played their music, but mostly everyone was focused on the\ndestination.\n\nAnd it wasn't all that bad. It only took us 3.5 hours of walking, and one stop\nat a small area with benches, to reach the end of this 17 kilometer stretch in\nCalzadilla de la Cueza. Believe it or not, I'm halfway to Santiago!\n\nThe clouds disappeared after breakfast in Calzadilla as we continued towards\nLedigos, and Terradillos de los Templarios. As the sun shined down upon us, the\ntemperatures rose.\n\nCrissi and I were walking so fast that as we entered Ledigos we realized that we\nhad left Bianca behind. We waited around for her to show up, but she never did.\nShe most likely took a break earlier on without us noticing.\n\nWe arrived at Terradillos de los Templarios just after noon. There was a little\npicnic area amongst what appeared to be the ruins of an old well, and we found\na few other pilgrims there. This was the first spot of shade since leaving\nCalzadilla, so we joined them at the stone table with some cold cokes.\n\nTerradillos was technically a stage ender, but Crissi and I were feeling\nadventurous (or crazy) and decided to push on. We said our goodbyes and hit the\nroad once more, deciding to make it as far as Sahagún before calling it quits\nfor the day. If only we had known how much it was going to hurt.\n\nWe spent the next hour making bets on how much further we had to go before we\nwould see the next town (I lost them all), and talking about why we disliked\nour jobs and what we were going to do about it. It was here that I think I\nofficially decided to start looking for something new.\n\nFinally, after losing the second bet, we reached the top of a hill and spied\nMoratinos sitting a kilometer away. Several stone messages, and arrows, dotted\nthe path as we hiked downhill into town.\n\nThey had their own little Hobbitville here which were actually Bodegas (a sign\nliterally said \"No, Hobbits do NOT live here\"). Trees wrapped in blankets\ndominated the small town square in front of the church as we headed out. A few\nkilometers later we came upon San Nicolás del Real Camino. A local Albergue had\nan attached restaurant, which meant more sugar-filled Coca Cola, and making\nsure we were ready to do the final push to Sahagún.\n\nWe arrived in the city at 4pm after taking an odd, twisting, path that took us\nout of our way just so we could see an old church, and some stone statues.\nThanks Camino.\n\nThe Municipal Albergue in this city was an old church, and the beds + kitchen +\nbathrooms were in the upper level/attic of the church. We got to choose our\nbeds before checking in and paying. This place, oddly, had the best Wi-Fi so\nfar on the Camino. I updated my music library later that night because\nlistening to the same songs for 16 days gets old, fast.\n\nNot much was in our little area of town, and after walking 40 kilometers we were\nnot in the mood for exploring the city by foot. There was a small hostel cafe\nacross the street from the church, and Bianca walked by as we were checking it\nout. We were so happy to see her, and to see that she made it safe 'n sound. By\nnow it was getting close to 6pm and we were overdue for our afternoon naps.\n\nIt was Sunday, and nothing was open, which meant no cooking tonight. We retired\nto our beds, but ended up napping for too long. We awoke in the evening, around\n8pm or so.\n\nCrissi and I grabbed a late dinner at a large restaurant across the street, and\nwatched part of the world cup game. As we were leaving the restaurant Luis\nfound us and practically dropped to his knees. He had forgotten the passcode\nfor the church door and was panicking thinking that he would have to sleep\noutside tonight.\n\nToday’s walking total was 39 kilometers, the longest stretch yet. It felt as bad\nas the walk into Hontanas three days earlier. I guess after a certain point the\npain is the same. For me, it usually kicks in around 20 kilometers, which in an\nodd way helps me know how much ground has been covered for the day. Tomorrow is\nhopefully an easier day, seeing as how we did 1.5 stages today. Our planned\ndestination is Mansilla, but we'll see if that actually happens.\n\n";
