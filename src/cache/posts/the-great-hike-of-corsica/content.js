export const content = "\nThis was the last thru-hike on my list of places that I had first discovered\nback in 2018. It was said to be the hardest of them all, but I thought \"hey,\nI've done the Himalays and survived, I can do anything\". Boy was I wrong, this\nwas definitely the hardest thru-hike I have ever done. But, it was also one of\nthe most rewarding because it allowed me to cement what I liked and didn't like\nabout thru-hiking, and how I would do future hikes.\n\n<Stats />\n\n<Route />\n\n## What is the Great Hike of Corsica\n\nThe Grande Randonnee (GR) 20 is a \"Great Hike\" footpath that crosses the\nMediterranean island of Corsica running from north to south, described as\n\"one of the top trails in the world\". The trail is considered to be the\nmost difficult of all the GR routes in Europe, and I can agree with that.\n\nIt consists of a northern part, and a southern part. The northern part,\nbetween Calenzana and Vizzavona, is the more difficult part because of\nthe steep and rocky paths while the southern part, between Vizzavona and\nConca, is easier with rolling hills and green as far as the eye can see.\n\nThis particular trail is one where camping is most common form of shelter\nat the various mountain huts known as \"Refuges\" along the trail. Each of\nthese Refuges provided basic services including home-cooked meals,\nbathrooms, and showers. I went during the summer months of June and July\nbecause summer is usually the best time to go since most of the refuges\nare opened and staffed.\n\n<World\n  markers={[\n    {\n      left: '46.5%',\n      top: '24%',\n    },\n  ]}\n/>\n\n## Where I spent each night\n\nLuckily for this thru-hike I didn't have to book anything in advance since\nI was camping the whole way. All I had to do was show up, say I had a tent, and\npitch it wherever there was an open spot.\n\nEach Refuge provided a place to cook your meals, and a full kitchen for ordering\nfood and meals, as well as shower and bathroom facilities.\n\n## What I brought\n\nFor this particular trek I wanted to go as light as possible in order to have a\nmore pleasant time hiking over this mountainous terrain, and its narrow/steep\nledges. So I had to look at every piece of gear I currently owned and see where\nI could drop the ounces. Here are some items that I purchased for this specific\ntrek:\n\n<Checklist\n  items={[\n    'Durston X-Mid 1 tent',\n    'Ultralight sleeping bag',\n    'Thin sleeping pad',\n    'Small power bank',\n    'One trekking pole',\n    'E-reader instead of a book',\n    'Ultralight fleece',\n    `Ultra-thin flip-flops`,\n    `Tiny ultralight towel`,\n    `Ultralight backpack`,\n  ]}\n/>\n\nThis was my first time with ultralight gear, and I learned a lot about what\nworked for me, and what didn't work.\n\nThe tent worked for the most part, but you had to get the setup and pitch just\nright in order for it to work, and most of the ground was too hard for stakes.\nOn one night the wind won and took down the tent, so I had to purchase one of\nthe provided heavy-duty tents at the Refuge.\n\nThe flip-flops were a bad idea as they provided zero protection from the rocky\nground. I quickly swapped those out for a thicket pair of flipflops I bought at\na shop at one of the Refuges.\n\nA tiny towel was also a bad idea. It didn't have enough surface area for\nabsorbing all the water off of my body after a shower. But it did dry really\nquickly.\n\n## Stages that I followed\n\nSince it was a show up and go, I could easily pick and choose where I wanted\nto stay. I mostly followed the guidebook, especially since this turned out to be\na very tough thru-hike due to the mountainous terrain.\n\n<Stages />\n\nThis thru-hike had its ups and downs, but overall it was a great experience. I\neven formed a group of friends on the first day and we hiked together all the\nway to Vizzavona, the halfway point. But we split up from there since some were\ntaking a rest day, and others wanted to start moving at different speeds.\n\nAfter the halfway point I began combining stages due to how easy the southern\nportion was, and I was eager to get to the hotels I had booked in two different\ncities so that I could actually explore the place I was thru-hiking in for once!\n\n";
