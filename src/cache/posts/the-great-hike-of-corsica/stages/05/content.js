The trail went along a rocky trail as it curved its way\nthrough the trees around us, and provided lots of lookout points for us to\nenjoy the large expansive forested valley below. Several trees littered the ground, as we crossed over small rivers fed by waterfalls.\n\n<Stats />\n\n<Route />\n\nAbout 30 minutes later the trail turned from dirt to rock and began ascending up the steep mountainside as I took more frequent breaks on the way up. Luckily my knees were still doing great, but one of the knee pads' velcro was starting to fail.\n\nAbout halfway up we stopped at a large waterfall and filled up our bottles, and\nsoaked our hats in the ice-cold water. Such a refreshing feeling!\n\nWe made it to the top of the col, and finished the hardest part of the trail\ntoday by 9:00 am. Amazingly the Mediterranean Sea is still visible from these\nhigh-up points. There is a refuge up here called Refuge Miori and we stopped\nthere to take a break. I had my first Orangina sugary drink, like a Fanta they\nsay, but on steroids. Regardless, it was delicious and gave me a nice boost of\nenergy.\n\nThe trail coming down from Refuge Miori was relatively easy. It was mostly dirt,\nand had a nice easing slope to it. We passed a pair of cows chilling in the\nbushes as we made our way down. Near the bottom I paused and looked back, wow,\nsuch an amazing sight seeing how far we'd come in just 60 minutes.\n\nUp ahead were a series of cascading waterfalls, and one of these cascading\nareas had a large flat rocky entrance, which we decided to take full advantage\nof and stripped down to our underwear and went swimming in. Oh man was it cold, but such a refreshing feeling!\n\nAs we continued on our way a herd of goats led by their owners started coming\ndown a steep mountainside and onto the trail. We were delayed for a short\nwhile and had to move slowly as the goats made their way, and their owners tried to herd them away.\n\nAfter passing the goats we crossed a bridge and about 10 minutes later\ncame to a small food stand that was selling cheese-filled pancakes and\nlasagna. We grabbed a table in the shade and treated ourselves to some of those cheese-filled pancakes, and they were delicious!\n\nWe continued on through lush green forests and I ended up speeding through parts of the trail. Once at the hotel we settled in and busted out a deck of cards to pass the time.\n\nI bought some flip flops at the hiker shop for wearing around camp. The ones I had brought with me weighed nothing and were super thin, which was great for keeping my pack weight down, but they were too thin for walking around on this rough terrain at the campsites.\n\nThis was the biggest and most delicious dinner of the trip so far. Steak with\nfries and egg salad, and dessert!\n\nTomorrow promises to be the easiest day so far, but we'll see...";
