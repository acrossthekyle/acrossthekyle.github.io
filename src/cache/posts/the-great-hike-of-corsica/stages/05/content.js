I was able to move quite\nfast today, and was able to keep up with Charles and Sophie for nearly most of\nthe morning as we left the Auberge. Peter and Tyezet were already ahead of us\n(they're super fast), and Dennis would meet up with us later at the hotel\ncampground.\n\nThe trail out of the Auberge went along a rocky trail as it curved its way\nthrough the trees around us, and provided lots of lookout points for us to\nenjoy the large expansive forested valley below. Several large dead trees\nlittered the ground, as we crossed over small rivers fed by waterfalls. I had\npulled ahead of the others and, knowing they would catch up to me, tried to\nmake as good of time as I could on this mostly flat ground before the ascent up\nto a col coming up.\n\nSure enough, about 30 minutes later as the trail turned from rocky dirt to\nsolid rock and began ascending up the stone mountainside, Charles and Sophie\ncaught up to me, and even passed me as I took more frequent breaks than them\non the way up. Luckily though my knees were still doing great, but one of the\nknee pads' velcro was starting to fail, meaning I had to keep stopping and\nresetting it. Might want to look into replacing it when this trip is done.\n\nAbout halfway up we stopped at a large waterfall and filled up our bottles, and\nsoaked our hats in the ice-cold water. Such a refreshing feeling!\n\nWe made it to the top of the col, and finished the hardest part of the trail\ntoday by 9:00 am. Amazingly the Mediterranean Sea is still visible from these\nhigh-up points. There was a refuge up here called Refuge Miori and we stopped\nthere to take a break. I had my first Orangina sugary drink, like a Fanta they\nsay, but on steroids. Regardless, it was delicious and gave me a nice boost of\nenergy.\n\nThe trail coming down from Refuge Miori was relatively easy. It was mostly dirt,\nand had a nice easing slope to it. We passed a pair of cows chilling in the\nbushes as we made our way down. Near the bottom I paused and looked back, wow,\nsuch an amazing sight seeing how far we'd come in just 60 minutes.\n\nUp ahead were a series of cascading waterfalls, and one of these cascading\nareas had a large float rocky entrance, which we decided to take full advantage\nof and stripped down to our underwear and went swimming in. Oh man was it cold!\nCharles was brave enough to go to the top of the cascading waterfall into this\npool of water and jump. Luckily it was super deep, but I wasn't brave enough\nto do that. Such a refreshing feeling!\n\nAs we continued on our way a herd of goats led by their owners started coming\ndown a steep mountainside and onto the trail. We were delayed for a short\nwhile and had to move slowly as the cute little goats made their way, and their\nowners tried to herd them off of the rocky trail.\n\nAfter getting passed the goats we crossed a bridge and about 10 minutes later\ncame to a small food stand that was selling cheese-filled pancakes and\nlasagna. Peter and Tyezet were already there and had been waiting for us at a\ntable in some shade. Charlie treated us to some of those cheese-filled pancakes\nand they were so freaking delicious. I had another Orangina (I was hooked now).\n\nNow as a nearly whole group (Dennis was still far behind us) we continued on\nthrough lush green forests and I ended up speeding through parts of the trail\nwith Tyezet and we talked about various things. I like our group, they're a good\nbunch of people. We had to double back at one point because Charlie and Sophie\nhad fallen behind without us realizing it. Sophie's legs were starting to hurt,\nbadly, but they made it to the hotel and campground. They (Charlie and Sophie)\nended up \"giving me\" their hotel room even though I begged them to take it\nbecause of her injuries. But they really wanted to camp.\n\nI couldn't bring my backpack up to my room due to the weird hotel rules, so I\nhad to stash it in a locker at the entrance, but they had a tote bag in the\nlocker for you to take stuff up to your room so I dumped the entire backpack\ninto it. It's going to make packing it up in the morning a pain, but at least I\nwas able to bring every up and lay it all out to be cleaned and dry.\n\nI took a nice long shower, and washed all of my clothes in the bathroom sink. I\ntried to dry them with the hairdryer but that was taking too long so I hung\neverything up on hangers in the closet and put on wet boxers and a wet shirt,\nwith my dry joggers, and went to go hangout at the campsite with the others.\nI figured my stuff would air dry while I was out there.\n\nCharlie taught us a new card game, of which I can now not remember it or how\nto play it, but we didn't get to finish it before it was time to get ready\nfor dinner. I stopped at the general store next to the campground on the way\nback to my room and picked up some breakfast foods to eat. Breakfast at the\nhotel didn't start until 7:00 am which meant a late start, and that's no good.\nI bought some flip flops for the shower and for wearing around camp as well. The\nones I had brought with me weighed nothing and were super thin, which was cool\nand kept my pack weight down, but they were actually horrible and couldn't\nreally do anything (couldn't walk around in them, push in tent stakes, etc.).\n\nWhen I got back to my room I saw that other people had put their laundry on the\nshared patio outside of our balconies so I moved my clothes there. It's unlikely\nthat they were going to dry in room since there was no air circulation. Afterwards\nI chilled on my rooms own balcony, staring tt the mountains.\n\nFinally it was time for dinner at the hotel, and four of us and bought tickets\nto the dinner instead of cooking food from the general store at the campground.\nThis was the biggest and most delicious dinner of the trip so far. Steak with\nfrieds and egg salad, and dessert!\n\nTomorrow promises to be the easiest day so far, but we shall see\n\n";
