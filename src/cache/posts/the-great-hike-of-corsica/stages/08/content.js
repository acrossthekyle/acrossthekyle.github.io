The temperature got as low as\n53ËšF, and the wind chill was probably 10+ degrees colder. Good news though: the\nsleep system worked well, and the tent with its stacks under rocks also held up.\n\nDuring our breakfast of jam on toast and chocolate milk (oh so healthy) I was\nable to see some cloud inversion. Always a treat, to me at least. The dutch\nset out before everyone else, as per usual, and the rest of our troop descended\nfrom the refuge together.\n\nThe descent was initially very steep as we used our trekking poles as braces for\nhoping down from rocky ledge to rocky ledge, and down the various switchbacks.\nBut eventually it became a more gradual and pleasant descent. We passed by\nmany waterfalls as we went, and lots of cows were in the area keeping us\ncompany.\n\nJust before the halfway point today we took a break at a Bergerie that sold\nquiche! But, to be honest, their cheese was awful. I couldn't stomach it and\nhad to give it away to anyone else in our group. Their bread was descent though,\nand I snacked on that.\n\nThe trail just before and after the Bergerie was amazing because it was\nflat, and went through forests filled with tall trees spaced far apart. A large\nriver ran beside us over smooth boulders as we worked our way down. At the\n\"bottom\" of the trail there was a bridge over the river and below this bridge\nwas another little swimming area. Peter And Tyezet met up with us there after\ndropping their gear at the refuge and coming back down the trail. These guys\nare machines! We did some swimming in the waterfall/river, and it was much much\ncolder than the other day of swimming. Some of us even jumped off of the bridge\ninto the river below, althought I wouldn't recommend this.\n\nIt would take about another hour to get up to the refuge through some gradual\nand then steep hiking, mostly over a wide trail just after the bridge and then\nover more narrower and rockier paths that slowly gained up the green hills\naround us. The camping at the refuge is in a grassy field, so it's easier to\nget a better tent pitch, but it's still not perfect. I'm thinking of seeling\nthis freestanding ultralight tent after this trip.\n\nFinally, the first cold shower of the trip! I was wondering when this would\nhappen. The number of hot showers on this trek was too good to be true! We\nplayed some more Liar, and another card game called Bullet. Afterwards I napped,\nlooking forward to dinner and this supposedly famous lasagna. Dinner was delayed\nfor nearly an hour after we were seated, and the lasagna was just ok, in my\nopinion. Luckily we got seconds though. And dessert was chocolate mouse again!\n\nAfter dinner our group said their goodbyes since we're all splitting up after\ntoday. It was very very sad. These people were awesome, and tons of fun. Some\nare doing a double tomorrow, while others are taking a rest day in the town of\nVizzagona. I had a hotel room booked there though, and I was eager to make use\nof their laundry services and get all of my clothing washed.\n\nIt's gonna be a chilly night tonight.\n\n";
