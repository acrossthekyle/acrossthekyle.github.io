I didn't hear a single\nperson snoring. On this trip I had brought a mini thermometer with me so that I\ncould keep track of how well my sleep system would perform based on the various\ntemperatures throughout the trip. Temps got down to 63ËšF last night, and I was\ncomfortable inside my quilt. A good start!\n\nI woke up around 5:30 am in order to catch the sunrise but there wasn't much to\nsee: it was hidden behind a ridge of mountains. I set about packing up my gear,\nand getting ready for the day. Breakfast at the eating area was\nplain, as expected. The kitchen is a small operation, so it was just yogurt\nand bread and jam/nutella. I ran into a couple of the people from last night and\nwe were all meeting up at the same place, so I said goodbye and would see them\nthere. I filled up my water bottles and hit the trail.\n\nFrom the start it was all uphill, but I was doing a much better job at pacing\nmyself today than yesterday, and therefore was making good progress. It quickly\nturned into more scrambling and climbing, which wasn't the most fun, not gonna\nlie, but as I said compared to yesterday I was doing much better. No leg pains!\n\nA frustrating thing happened though as I was taking pictures while climbing: my\nphone decided to lock itself and prevent me from using it for about an hour due\nto too many unsuccessful unlock attempts. I'm not sure how that happened, maybe\nfrom me swiping right on the home screen to get to the camera without waiting\nfor it to unlock, but I missed out on some great photos because of it. That put\nme in a bad mood because there were some pretty epic shots! I could have sat and\nwaited for an hour, but it was really windy in this area and I didn't want to\nfall behind.\n\nWhile I was doing better today, it was still harder than yesterday with lots of\nhiking up and down and up and down, plus the bits of climbing mixed in, and the\nunrelenting sun. There were some sketchy areas were you had to boulder across\nsevere drops with no chains. If it was raining this would be nearly impossible\nto do.\n\nThe views were great, but after the third or fourth ridge pass I was starting to\nwonder if it would ever start descending. Obviously it had to eventually, and\nit did, but that joy didn't last for long. The trail heading down was mostly\nloose rocks which was kind of dangerous given how steep some sections were. The\ndescent seemed to last forever. Finally I could see the refuge as a tiny blue\ndot in the distance, but every time I went around a turn it didn't seem to be\ngetting any closer.\n\nOh, and I forgot I had the packed lunch, so that went to waste. Could have used\nthe food though. I was energy deprived and dehydrated even though I drank like\n3-4 liters of water throughout the day. Apparently that wasn't enough in these\nhot valleys, and I would need to do better.\n\nI made it to the refuge after cursing the trail multiple times due to the heat,\nthe loose scree underneath, and the fact that the trail seemed to be deliberatly\ntaking the long way around. I also got banged up by rocks all over my shins and\nankles, with some cuts as well.\n\nI had a hard time finding a level spot, and ended up using some wood pallets as\na base which meant using rocks to hold everything down. It worked, but we'll see\nhow it holds up in the wind tonight (it's getting really windy right now). But\ngood news is that I'm parked right next to Denis, Peter, and Tyezet!\n\nSince I had arrived after everyone else in my new group I had to eat dinner with\na group of French people due to assigned seating (I was in the second dinner\ngroup). They didn't speak much English, which made for a quick dinner.\n\nI hung out with the gang before going to bed early. I can smell the toilets from\nhere. Not a pleasant thing at all.\n\n";
