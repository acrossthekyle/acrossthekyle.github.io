I packed up early in order to try and\nmake today a leisurely day given it would be another long day on trail, at nearly\n8 hours. I stuffed the wet things into my bag and ate the \"breakfast\".\n\nThe day started off with a steep rise through woods but leveled out for a\nbit and turned into bright green fields with a lovely river trickling through\nit before switchbacking to a Col. It was very windy as the clouds rolled in and over me,\nand I had to throw on my windbreaker, first time this trip! I made it to the\ntop of the Col and was presented with amazing views of the Mediterranean Sea.\nThe winds up here nearly knocked me over, and for some reason it was freezing\ncold as well.\n\nI passed by the refuge up here, Refuge Prati, and it just looked very \"sad\",\nI'm glad I didn't stay here, and I found out later from a friend that it was\nterrible. Apparently it was so windy that lots of people had to go into the\nrefuge eating area to sleep because their tents got taken out. Really great\nviews of the clouds rolling by as I got higher and higher though.\n\nThe views from up here were amazing. I could see for miles in every direction,\nbut the clouds kept coming and before too long the whole area was covered in fog.\nThere was a lot of ridges to walk along, and then go up and over, repeatedly. The\ntrail also had a lot of narrow areas that had steep drops off to the right of me.\n\nThe whole day ended up being descend then ascend then descend then ascend,\nwhile clouds made it hard to see anything more than 30 feet in front of me.\nI had to climb over a field of steep boulders that seemed like they would give\nway at any moment, and doing this in the thick fog made it even more scary.\n\nEventually the clouds lifted and I could see the trail stretch out in front of me.\nIt was an amazing sight! It went along the ridge of a mountain for a while, and\nthen through some trees, before starting to go in circles, or so it felt. At one\npoint it felt like the trail was doubling back on itself around the top of a\nmountain. Col after Col, and still no descent towards the refuge.\n\nFinally a descent! And finally a view of the refuge. It's much higher up than\nI thought it would be, which probably means an exposed camping area and rough\nwinds. Oh joy. On the way into the refuge area I had to walk past some angry\nlooking horses. I made sure to keep my distance.\n\nThis wasn't the best refuge on the trip, for many reasons. The host and workers\nspeak zero English, so I had a hard time communicating to them. Eventually I was\nable to pre-pay for dinner, and since they didn't have a kitchen that you could\norder things from but rather a general store I just picked up a bunch of small\nrandom foods and retreated to a nearby picnic table to scarf them down.\n\nWhile I hung out in my tent waiting for dinner the tent collapsed on me from\nthe string wind gusts. I reinforced all stakes with more rocks, and even tied\nout four additional loop holes and guy lines. It held together for now. This\ntent, while very being light weight and roomy for its size/weight, was not the\nbest at shedding winds.\n\nThis trek has been great, with amazing views and varied terrain, and has been\na great experience overall, but it's also been super hard technically speaking.\nAnd some of my gear choices have been terrible. And it isn't that great once\nyou're all alone on it.\n\nThis place didn't have a covered eating area, or space to eat inside, so I had\nto eat dinner outside in the rain. I made the decision to see if they had a\ntent available for purchase. Luckily, they did. And good timing to. My tent\ncouldn't handle the wind and rain, even with all of the extra stakes. I had to\nundo one of the extra stake-out points to be able to roll the door out of the\nway in order to pack things up, and as soon as I did the tent collapsed.\n\nI was able to load everything inside the tent into my backpack, and stuff it in\ngood for the quick walk to the purchased tent. The tent I brought now sits in a\ncorner on the other half of this purchased tent, wet and dirty. Not going to\neven bother cleaning it or drying it out tonight. I will just stuff it up\ntomorrow morning and see what weather the day/night brings at the next Refuge.\n\nI'm glad I worked up the guts to ask the host for a purchased tent. It was the\nbest decision I could have made. Now I will chill in here while the rain rages\noutside. I can't fully stretch out in this new tent thought, apparently it was\nbuilt for smaller people. I feel alone, sequestered in this tent tucked into a\ncorner next to the dormitory. This refuge sucks, but I'm thankful for this tent.\n\nInstead of being a sad sack in here I decided to turn my mood up. I did my\nevening bathroom business, brushed my teeth, and when I got back to my tent I\ngot busy. I popped in my headphones, turned on noise cancellation to cancel out\nthe storm raging outside, and the first song that popped on shuffle was \"Where\nIs My Mind\" by Maxence Cyrin. Great song to start things off with! Then \"Release\nMe\" by Corrina repo, followed by \"Edging\" by Blink-182. Not a bad set of jams to\nget my head cleared out. I folded up the wet tent (it wasn't going to dry\novernight in this tiny tent anyways), got the loose gravel out of my backpack,\ngot everything organized into piles and set up for tomorrow morning.\n\nAfter getting everything situated I started to read and then fell asleep.\n\n";
