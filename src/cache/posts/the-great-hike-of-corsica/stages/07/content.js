I will just have to alternate my\nsingle remaining one throughout the day. It's day seven, and that means there's\nonly seven more days to go. The trail has been hard and I'm enjoying it, but I'm\nalso starting to look forward to the hotel at the end.\n\nBreakfast was more bread and jam, this time with some apple sauce, and some\nmore chocolate milk. Not the most filling, but what are ya gonna do?\n\nWe had a slow start to the day once we got going. The way out of the refuge\nwas back over the bridge we had come in on, and then the trail turned to the\nright and headed up towards a mountain ridge pass in the far distance. Just\nabove the refuge was more bog-like grounds, and it was tricky once again trying\nto find a way through it.\n\nThe trail went through shrubs of trees and rocks as it wound its way up the\nstones towards the ridge pass. We took a wrong turn at one point and had to\ndouble back, losing some time. The sun was rising behind this ridge, and thus\nthe whole trail was in dark shadow. It took us about two hours to get to the\ntop. We took a well-deserved break on the stony ground near the ridge pass,\nwith a huge dropoff danging below us.\n\nThe way down to the next, lower, ridge wasn't that bad. There were some drops\nwere we had to scoot down on our butts, and rely on some chains for the other\nparts. We decided to take an easier lower route from there instead of taking\nthe harder upper route and scrambling over sharp-looking rocks.\n\nWe took a break in some shade of a large boulder after completing the lower\nroute, and before continuing along the trail that seemed to run for a good while\nalong the side of a mountain. It was chilly with the wind in the shade of this\nboulder, which meant we didn't hang out here long. Overall it's very windy in\nthis area.\n\nAbout an hour and a half later and I finished the flat section of the trail and\nmade it up the ascent to a snow-patch covered area with ice-cold waters perfect\nfor dipping your feet in. The waters were too dirty to fully get into, but they\nwere just right for my feet.\n\nWith cold refreshed feet I continued on towards the descent into the next refuge\nfor the night. The way down was a lot steeper than it looked from high above.\nIt was filled with switchbacks, very steep switchbacks, and waterfalls, making\nthe rocks extra slippery. But I made it down faster than I thought I would, and\nwhen I went to checkin I ran into Peter and Tyezet chilling in the shaded\neating area of the refuge. Once again they had saved some spots for us.\n\nI got the tent set up, but I could tell that it was going to be a windy night.\nI still haven't figured out how to properly pitch the tent, and that's also\nprobably due to having to use rocks for the tent stakes at every campsite\nbecause of the rock-hard ground. I hope they hold.\n\nThis place has Sundaes! And eggs! I ordered a plate of fries on top of fried\neggs, a coke (first of the trip), and a sundae for lunch. Super healthy, right?\nI didn't care, it was amazing. It hit the spot. We played some exploding kittens,\nand I read for a bit, while waiting for dinner.\n\nDinner was pre-assigned seating, which meant our group wouldn't be sitting\ntogether. Bummer. I ended up eating dinner with a bunch of non-english speaking\nstrangers except for two other Belgians who spoke English, so I spoke with them\nwhile we ate. Everyone is amazed that I came all the way from Chicago\nspecifically to do this trek. I still haven't met any other Americans though.\n\nAfter dinner our gang played some more card games, one called Liar this time.\nSupposedly the refuge tomorrow has amazing lasagna, so I'm definitely looking\nforward to that!\n\n";
