Last night the clouds had started to get\nreally low to the ground, and as we slept they must have crept in and over\nthe campground because there was condensation of everything. Good thing I'm\ngoing to a hotel today with laundry services. I also got the earliest start of\nthe trip so far today, mainly because mostly everyone else was too.\n\nThe way up and out of the refuge was rough. It was very steep, and I had to\npause often, and it was hard to see as the fog rolled in, but it was totally\nworth it for the views once I got up there. The clouds were in abundance, and\nfrom my high vantage point I watched as they rolled over the ridge I had just\ncome from, and the sun shone behind them, creating the best cloud inversion I\nhad ever seen. I was truly above the clouds, and it was amazing. I paused there\nfor a good amount of time staring and watching.\n\nThe rest of the way up the trail to the high-point of today wasn't too bad, but\nthe descent was another story. The descent was <em>really</em> steep, and my\nankles were so twisted. I had to traverse practically smooth rock and move\nnearly horizontally for a while, before the trail reached a point where it\nturned into jumping down from large boulder to large boulder. It went like this\nfor quite a while, but luckily the descent eventually flattened out and the\nrest of the way was through forests.\n\nThis was the easiest walk into town I had had all trip. After the descent was\ndone the forested part was so easy. And everntually the trail merged with a\nforest preserve, which had nice wide and luxurious gravel trails. It was so easy\nin fact that I arrived at 10:45 am! I needed to wait three hours before the room\nwould be ready so I went over to the local refuge campground (practically\nacross the street) to see if anyone had arrived and sure enough I ran into Peter\nand Tyezet. We went to a local bar in town (which was really just a grouping of\n5 or so buildings and a train station) for drinks and snacks. Everything is very\nexpensive in this tiny town, even more expensive than when on top of a mountain!\nWe returned to my hotel and hung out in some lounger chairs in a garden area. But\nthe room was ready almost immediately after sitting down so I said my goodbyes\nonce more and headed up.\n\nFinally, laundry. And I laid out all of my gear so that it could air out. I took\na nice long shower, and then napped. It rained while I was falling asleep,\nlove it! Dinner was soon, which was good because I was starving. The dinner itself\nwas alright, nothing to great though, and I was expecting more from this hotel.\nAnd they have breakfast at 7:00 am so it'll be a late start to the trail for me,\nbut that's ok because it's only 5 hours tomorrow.\n\n";
