export const content = "\n<Stats />\n\n<Route />\n\nI slept really well last night in the hotel bed. The same thing happened again\nthough with my phone: it played white noise all night and it stopped charging.\nLuckily I was able to get it up to 100% before leaving today. It felt really\ngood to sleep in. Breakfast at the hotel was as plain as the refuges, a shame.\n\nIt started raining while we ate, which delayed my start by about 1 hour.\n\nAs soon as the rain stopped I was out the door and back on trail. The trails\nin the south are so much easier than the north. It was a leisurely walk along\nwide, well maintained trails. All of the rivers and waterfalls were overflowing\nthough thanks to the heavy rains yesterday afternoon and this morning, which\nmade some crossings tricky (trying to keep my shoes as dry as possible).\n\nI was up and over the Col just above the town of Vizzagona and on my way to the\nfirst refuge after only 1.5 hours! It was really windy up there though, and I\nnearly lost my hat, so I didn't stay long but I tried to take lots of photos. On\nthe trail up from Vizzavona I ran into orange and black lizards know as Fire\nLizards. They were decently sized, maybe as big as a soccerball.\n\nI chugged right along though until I reached Capenelle, my original destination\nfor the day. But it was too early to stay here, I would have been bored, plus\nit was a ski lift area and the camping was right under them, not the most ideal\nif you ask me. But, this place was known for having good pizza, so I took a\nbreak and had some. The pizza itself was huge! I had to fold the pieces to eat\nit, and eat it quickly I did, it was so delicious. I took my leave of the\nrefuge and started on the way to the next one.\n\nThe trails were so flat and easy to walk (even with the occasional ascents and\ndescents). I passed by many abandoned refuges. Who knows how long they've been\nthis way. The route meandered through fields, zig-zagged up and down pine-wood\nfilled mountainsides, and switchbacked down towards deep dark forests. I had\nnice sweeping views of the valley from many a place on trail today. Part of\nthe way required walking a road for a bit, but nothing too long. Eventually\nI realized that I was alone on trail, and hadn't seen another human for a while.\n\nIt rained off and on throughout the day, but I didn't need a rain coat because\nI was under trees for most of it. A very dreary day overall. I was doing good\non energy, and was powering through todays portion. It was definitely going to\nbe a double-stage today. After a while I started to wonder how far it was to\nthe next place to stay. And for a long time I was walking through a pine forest\nfor what seemed like ages and ages, not knowing if I was even on the right\ntrail anymore.\n\nFor nearly an hour I wondered this, until finally I came across an official\nplace to stay called Bocca di Verdi that was reachable by road, but I debated\ngoing on simply because I wanted to be somewhere more rustic. I asked the\nguardian how much further to the next refuge, and he said about 2 hours. It was\nalready 4:00 pm by this point and I had just done 17 miles of straight hiking\ntoday. I opted to stay at this place.\n\nLuckily I had also arrived just in time to order dinner. This place has log\ncabins, and a fireplace in the main building! I could have rented a cabin for\nmyself, but the ground was flat here with tree coverage so I decided to bust\nout my dry tent and let it get all wet again. After getting camp set up I went\nto the main building and at first tried to read outside but it was getting\nvery windy and was still raining, so I read inside at a table next the fireplace.\n\nDinner was a lot of food! And chocolate mousse again for dessert!\n\nThe sun keeps trying to peak out from behind the clouds. I hope the weather over\nthe next few days is more pleasant. It's going to be windy tonight, hopefully\nthe tent walls won't attack me. Oh and one pair of the socks now has a heel\nhole. Definitely going to toss them as soon as the trek is done.\n\n";
