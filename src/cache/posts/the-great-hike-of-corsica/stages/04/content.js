Everyone in our group started at different times today, so that meant\nI was going solo for the entire day. The breakfast buffet at the hotel was\namazing, and definitely needed. I filled up on eggs, sausage, and so much\nbread. With a full belly I packed up my stuff and hit the trail.\n\nSince we had dropped a fair amount of elevation yesterday when arriving at\nthis place, it meant I had to go up right away after leaving the campsite, but\nI'm not complaining. It was through a lovely forest with clear views of the world\naround me as I went, and the trail was very well maintained. There was one big\nriver crossing, but I hopped between the rocks with ease as I crossed it. Once\nI was out of the trees it was time to start the hard part of todays hike, and\ngoing up to the highest point on the whole thru-hike. This meant lots of\nclimbing up rocks, and using chains to assist when they were provided.\n\nLots of people were struggling to get up the areas that had chains, and weren't\nusing them to their full advantage. As I got higher and higher I had to start\nmoving slower and slower, but I still kept a good pace. I was hiking through\nmountains now and loving it. The areas that needed chains started to become\nless frequent, and the trail transitioned to part rocky path part climbing over\nrocky obstacles. About 90 minutes later and I was at the first of two cols today,\nthe latter of which would be the highest point on the thru-hike.\n\nI stopped to explore the plateau and found a waterfall within a short walking\ndistance and proceeded to head there in order to quench my thirst and fill up\nmy water bottles. It was really buggy there, so I didn't stay long.\n\nOnce back on trail it would take about another 90 minutes to reach the high\npoint. On the way there the trail did a bunch of switchbacking on loose scree,\nand we had to walk over snow patches here and there. The part just below the top\nhad fresh snowmelt flowing down it which made it super slippery, and there\nwere no chains in this area. Combine that with a bunch of scrambling and\nclimbing in this area and it was a tough job getting to the top, but I eventually\nmade it safe-n-sound.\n\nAmazing views from up here! I'm as high as the clouds are right now. I could see\nthe rest of the trail on this high portion in the distance, and it didn't seem\nthat far, but the way down was tricky. There were some areas that were nice and\nwide and flat, and other areas that you could only get a single toe on as you\nhad to walk across this near-vertical wall of rock. It was nerve-racking.\n\nAfter making it through the risky tricky part, the trail now began going down\nloose scree and sandy dirt-like materials. It was slippery. And this meant my\nshoes would be full of this material as well given how fine it was. It would\ntake about two hours to make it down this long and slippery way. I did get\nlost at one point, due to the markers being hard to find sometimes. I wasn't the\nonly one though, and we ended up finding the way back to the trail.\n\nI made it to Auberge U Vallone by 3:00 pm in the afternoon. This was a nice little\nplace that had good views on their front dining area, but the entire area smelled\nlike animal droppings. I checked in, orderd dinner/breakfast, and then went to\nfind a spot to set up my tent. I found a good spot, with trees for hanging my\nclothing line so that I could air and dry my stuff out. The showers were nice\nand hot as well.\n\nThere was a small waterfall with a tidal pool right next to the Auberge, and lots\nof people were taking advantage of its ice cold waters to go swimming or dip\ntheir feet in. I joined in and found a spot in the lower area that was less\ncrowded and set about icing my feet up nice and good. When I got back to the\ntent I saw that Charles and Sophie had arrived, and learned that the others\nhad decided to stay at the refuge about 60 minutes before this place.\n\nI had veal for the first time for dinner. It's amazing how fast I've become\nnon-vegetarian on this hike and with Corsican cuisine. It tasted good though,\nand I didn't feel ill afterwards or anything like that. I might, I stress, I\nmight have a hotel room for tomorrow night. Charles and Sophie slept in a hotel\nroom last night, and had another one reserved for tomorrow night but decided\nthey'd rather camp, so they offered it to me and I accepted it!\n\nI'm starting to get some blisters on both of my feet. I wrapped them with the\ngauze I had brought as best I could. These toe socks I chose to wear for this\nhike are not so good, and I'm going to stick with Darn Tough from now on. And\nsome stronger hiking shoes. I don't know what happened to the quality of Altra\nshoes but these trail runners are already falling apart.\n\n";
