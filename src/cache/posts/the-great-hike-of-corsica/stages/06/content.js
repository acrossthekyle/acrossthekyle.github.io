I slept with white noise playing\nall night long. It got too hot in the room as well, and I was sweating all\nnight. Annoyingly my phone didn't charge overnight, which meant it might\ndie while on trail today, which would then mean no photos! Luckily it didn't.\n\nI ate my \"breakfast\" from yesterday on the baclony while watching the sunrise\nover the mountains. I headed downstairs and went about packing up my backpack\nin the hotel lobby. I met up with the others at the campground, and all of us\nminus Peter and Tyezet (they had gone ahead already), set off around 7:00 am.\n\nRight away the trail started going through some nice woods, and this was a nice\neasy way to start the day. The path was flat for nearly 3 miles! The woods\nalso had plenty of open areas that gave us pretty views of the mountains around\nus. Even when we had to start ascending, that portion wasn't that bad either.\n\nThe four of us, at the top of one of the ascents, paused and took a group photo\ntogether, and then took a break in some shade nearby. Cows started to move in\nthough and that meant that it was time to keep going. The trail now started\ngoing over exposed rocky hills, and zig-zagged through rocky columns.\n\nWe chose Lord of the Rings characters for ourselves because each ridge crossing\nreminded us of the first movie montage scene of them traversing over the\nmountains. I was given Aragorn, by Charlie, and Sophie called herself \"Bran the\nBroken\" due to her muscle issue. Apparently she was a huge George R.R. Martin\nfan and I told her my partner and her would get along swimingly. Sophie's\nleg issues though got worse throughout the day.\n\nThe rocky hillsides gave way to lush green hills and as we came over the summit\nof these hills we saw a pristine-looking mountain lake called Lac de Nino. As\nwe descended down the trail from the tops of the hills we discovered that the\nlake was actually surrounded by a bog, and it was tricky walking across it and\nmaking sure we didn't step on a soft spot and fall in. There were already some\nlarge holes in the surface that gave us a peek into the watery depths below. We\ndidn't swim in this lake though, it wasn't as pristine as it looked from up top,\nit was quiet dirty in fact. We took a short break on some boulders along\nthe waters edge before setting off again.\n\nThankfully the trail was flat once more for a few miles as its stone-white\npath cut through the bright green grasses around it. I was walking a little\nfaster than the others and had pulled ahead. I didn't realize the others weren't\nclose behind me until some time later, so I took a break and waited in the shade\nof a lovely tree for the others to catch up. When they did Sophie was in tears,\nsaying that the hike was over for her due to her leg issues. Charles ended up\ntaking her backpack and wearing it on this front while his remained on his back.\n\nWe made it to the next establishment along the trail, another Bergerie, and ate\nsome really really hard bread and tried to wash it down with more Orangina\ndrinks. Charles and Sophie had to decide if they wanted to stay at this place,\nor keep going. Dennis and I convinced them to keep going, and we split up her\nstuff so that Charles wouldn't have to carry most of it. With her backpack empty\nwe set off across the open plains ahead of us and made our way to the originally\nplanned place we were going to stay at. We all made it there together, in one\npiece.\n\nThe host wasn't very nice when we went to check in and order our meals. We set\nup our tents on spots that Peter and Tyezet had saved for us so that we could\nall camp together, those guys are the best! We noticed thought that cows kept\nwalking through the camping area, nicking some tents along the way with their\nhorns, so we rigged up some spare rope and rocks and made a sort of fence to\ntry and keep them out of our little circle.\n\nThere was a river flowing next the refuge, with some wide flat areas that\nwere ideal for chilling in the water, and we took advantage of it for a little\nbit.\n\nThe refuge dinner was simple but filling. They're all mostly pasta and red\nsauce with bread, a meat, and a dessert. The setting sun covered the eating\narea and it was a very hot dinner. It started to get chilly and we all retreated\nto the warmth of our sleeping bags in our tents. My feet have so many blisters,\nand I am running out of gauze wrap and bandaids.\n\n";
