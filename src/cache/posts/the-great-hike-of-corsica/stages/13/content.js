export const content = "Last night was a terrifying one. Horses decided to wander into the camping area\nafter everyone had gone to sleep, and literally walked right past my head. It's\na good thing it was a full moon and that they could see the tents, or else\nI worry what might have happened. But then dogs started barking at them,\nspooking the horses and causing them to start galloping through the tents in\norder to get away. I laid awake in fright for a while.\n\n<Stats />\n\n<Route />\n\nToday was the last day on trail, although I didn't quite know it yet. After\ndoing multiple days of double-stages I wasn't sure if I had it in me to do\nnearly 20 miles today and finish, so my goal for the day was to make it to\nthe last refuge on trail and spend the night there. With that in mind I packed\nup my stuff, and hit the trail.\n\nThe trail started off by heading straight down into a valley from the refuge for a while and then crossing over to the other side of the valley, and then back up for a bit before leveling out for a good long while. Here and there were waterfalls and some tiny rivers that required crossing, but overall the early morning portion was mostly even ground with very little ups and downs.\n\nFirst it was through a forest, and then up towards a more desert-looking\nterrain with the trail being exposed to the sun for nearly the entire time.\nAnd, sure enough, I got lost again. I must have not been paying attention to the\ntrail markers and probably missed a crucial one, but I ended up following a\ndifferent trail that took me in the completely wrong direction. I bushwhacked, scrambed, and climbed my way back to the main trail.\n\nOnce back on the trail I followed it closely and kept a vigilant eye out\nfor markers. It now started to go up and up towards a forested area and a\nlarge public park that had a large amount of hotels and places to stay just\ndown the road from it. I chose not to stop and take a break and to keep pushing\nthrough. The trail from this point was a very wide, and flat, dirt path.\n\nThe flat portion ended eventually, and now there was a steep ascent up towards\na mountain top. It took maybe an hour to get up there. From there it was\nanother series of ups and downs before arriving at the last refuge on trail. I\ndebated spending the night here, and after scoping it out and seeing that they\ntoo had cows and horses wandering through the campsite I decided that I had had enough of that and pushed on. I was going to finish today.\n\nIt was such a long day, with so many ups and downs in elevation. My feet were killing me. About three hours after leaving the last refuge behind, and after many tiring ascents/descents, I came to a pass in the rocks that signaled the\nbeginning of the end of the trail for me. It was like a gate you had to pass\nthrough.\n\nFrom here it would take about 30 minutes of racing downhill as fast as I could\ngo before I reached the end of the trail, and emerged from the woods onto a\npaved road that led into the town of Conca, and the official end of the trek. I\ncollapsed as I reached the bar that signaled the end, and I ran into my first\nAmerican there! We shared a celebratory beer and then headed off into town\nto find the local campground (the cheapest of the options). From there, in the\nmorning, I took a shuttle into Porto Vecchio where I had a hotel room waiting for me.\n\nThis trek was the hardest I had ever done, and the most amazing. I met a lot of\ngreat people, and while there were struggles (both physically and mentally) along the way, overall this thru-hike was a great experience.\n\nI have finally completed the list of treks I first created back in 2018. What\nan amazing feeling!";
