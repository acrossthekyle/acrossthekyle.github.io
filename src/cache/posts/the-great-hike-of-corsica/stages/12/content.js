The wind howled all night, and the rain didn't let up. I\ncouldn't stretch out fully in the tent, so I had to lay at an angle and/or curl\nup for most of the night. I packed up my backpack from inside the tent, which\nwas a nice touch (I coudn't do that in mine, not enough roof). These purchasable\ntents are daylight and bomb proof though; I opened the flap to a nice sun-filled\nand calm morning, nothing like last night.\n\nThe trail started off going up mountain ridges with minor scrambling here and\nthere as we hiked over ridge peak after ridge peak. These ridges and their\nhighs and lows looked deceptively small from far away, and seemed like they\nwould be easy to do, but once I got closer they were much greater than from\nfar away. I got lost a couple of times, simply becaues the markers were\ndifficult to find in certain areas.\n\nOnce the ridge portion was done it was time to go down a muddy series of\nswitchbacks towards the woods below. I was in good spirits as I raced down\nthis area. After that the trail started to level out, and go through a small\nstrand of trees. Finally, some easy trail!\n\nThese trees gave way to gently rolling green hills dotted with large boulders,\nand I could see far into the distance: this would be the trail for a good long\nwhile today, which was nice. I was making great time as well. There weren't\nkidding when they said the southern portion was much easier than the northern.\n\nHere and there large rivers and streams cut across the path, with some watery\ncrossings along the way. These were some of the greenest areas of the trail that\nI had seen so far on this trip. After the river portion was done it was time to\nhead through local farmers fields and past some other non-refuge places that\npeople could stay at. I could have stopped for breakfast, but it didn't look\nlike they were open for non-guest visitors just yet, so I kept going.\n\nThe trail was so easy today.\n\nUp and around a series of twists and turns through lush vegetation and I came\nto an abandoned house with plant-life of all colors around it. And not a trail\nmarker in sight. It took me and one other stranger a few random attempts of\nsearching in multiple directions before we found the markers and the resuming\nof the trail. Shortly after resuming the trail I came upon a refuge that I had\norinally planned on staying at, and I'm glad I didn't. It was so bare and plain\nlooking. I did stop though to rest and change out my bandaids on my blisters and\nsnack on the food I bought the previous night. On the way out some cows were\nblocking the path and I had to take a long detour around them.\n\nThe trail was now a dirt and gravel road for a while, but it turned off of here\neventually and it went through some very green land with a small river\nrunning through it. Once past that there was another place to stay and eat, and\nI decided to try and get some lunch here and found a good spot at a table in the\nshade. Unfortunately I struck out: the kitchen wasn't open yet and wouldn't be\nfor another hour or so. Disheartened I picked up my backpack and got back on\ntrail.\n\nFor the remainder of the afternoon the trail would go up at a steady rate,\nmostly along a road again before turning off it and going back into nature. The\nlandscape was very hilly and dotted with small boulders. It was a lovely sight.\nI was making amazing time time, doing two stages in one again. Eventually a\nlarge section of ascending to the high point of the day came up and this was\nthe hardest part.\n\nI didn't think the southern portion had any elevation points as high as the one\nI had just completed. It was nearly 6,500 feet above sea-level, and was up in\nthe clouds. I couldn't see the refuge from way up here, but I'm sure it was\ndown there somewhere. The descent was one of the worst though, especially after\ndoing a double-stage day. My knees were killing me. I made it to the refuge 1\nhour earlier than the official time the signs along the way said it would take!\n\nI'm glad this will be the last night of trying to pick a good tent spot and trying\nto get the tent pitch perfect, because after getting it set up and getting in\nit I realized there was a dip on the right side. I had to use a plank of wood\nto level it out, somewhat. It's working so far. I also had to resort to stuffing\nsome clothes under one end of the air mattress. Not my best set up.\n\nDinner here was delicious, and my stuff stayed dry overnight even though some\nclouds had decided to move in during dinner. There wasn't much to do up here,\nor many communal places to sit, and the temps were dropping gast, so I spent\nmost of the night reading in my tent.\n\n";
