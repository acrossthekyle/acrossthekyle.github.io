I slept really well last night, thank\nyou bunk bed. Everyone was getting up at 3am, so there was no worries about\nwaking anyone up unintentionally.\n\nToday was going to be a long day though: we would first hike up to the towers,\nhang out for a while while the sun rose, and then hike down, grab breakfast and\nour gear, and then head the rest of the way down back to the welcome center,\nand our bus ride out of here.\n\nWe packed up our phone cameras, left our bags behind, turned on our headlamps, and\nheaded out. When I had first day-hiked to the towers it was, well, during the day.\nDoing this in the darkness of the pre-dawn hours was a totally different\nexperience. The trail was well marked though, which made it easy to find our way.\n\nFinding a good spot at the top wasn't easy, but eventually we found one with\nshelter from the wind, and enough space for us all to set up our phone cameras\nin order to record (in timelapse) the rising sun. While we waited, someone\nstarted singing \"The Final Countdown\" which was very fitting since we kept\nchecking the time and staring intently at the rocks as they slowly appeared.\n\nIt was a truly magical experience. We all took turns taking photos staring\nat the towers. But sadly it was time to leave, and head back to civilization,\nand reality. The hike down was fast, it was all downhill afterall! We didn't\nhave to wait long the for the bus, and since we were all staying in the same\ntown we met up for dinner that night (our group was quite large now) for pizza.\n\nThis is how you end a hike, surrounding by friends you've made along the way.\n\n";
