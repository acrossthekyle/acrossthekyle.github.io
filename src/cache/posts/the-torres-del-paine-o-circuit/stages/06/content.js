Several tents had pieces bent, including\nmy own: one of the trekking poles bent in a strong suddent burst that sounded\nlike a gun going off in the distance. I had to tie some extra guywire string\naround the center pole in order to secure it against any future bursts, which\nworked and I was able to get another hour or two of sleep.\n\nSuch a beautiful morning though, as we came out of our tents the sun was\ncasting a bright pink light upon the clouds that hung out near the top of our\nnearby mountain peak.\n\nToday we would be hiking through ghost forests, and along a large lake that may\nor may not be connected to the ocean currents in the distance. Los Cuernos (the\nhorns) were a pair of mountain peaks that dominated the area and were within\nconstant sight. While the mileage might be higher than yesterday, the trail is\nso flat and easy to walk that we made great time. So great in fact that we\nwere able to do another side-trek on our way to Refugio Frances.\n\nValley Frances was the side trek, and it took us up behind Los Torres into\na wide circular valley that was chocked full of green forests, and interesting\nrock formations on the perimeter. The trail to get there was easy to walk\nand navigate. It went along a quickly flowing river, up and down over sandy and\nmuddy terrain, in and out of the trees. After about an hour of hiking we came\nto the valley center, and did a bunch of 360's, taking it all in.\n\nAbout two hours after leaving the valley, and retrieving our packs that we had\nleft at the entrance to the trail, we arrived at Frances. It was a campsite\nperched upon a tree-covered steep sloping hill, which meant everyone got a\nplatform to pitch their tent on. My tent barely fit (it's got a wide base), but\nI felt good about being within the trees: they would keep the winds away and we\ncould all sleep peacefully. The place to shower and cook was at the bottom of a\ntrail that went down towards the waters edge. I wasn't in the mood to go up and\ndown this trail very often while staying here, so I only went down there to\nshower, and then later to make dinner. I'm sure there was lots to see down there,\nI just wasn't in the mood.\n\nI read for a while in my tent after dinner, but the forest gets darker faster and\nbefore long it was time to go to sleep. Tomorrow we would be going to Chileno,\nour last Refuge, and then the day after that the Towers themselves!\n\n";
