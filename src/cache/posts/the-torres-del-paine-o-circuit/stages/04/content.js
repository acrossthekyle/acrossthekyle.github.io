Today's goal was reaching Grey's Glacier, and crossing over the\nhighest point of the trail. This meant a lot of ascending today, nearly non-stop\nclimbing as soon as we left Los Perros behind.\n\nI had gotten soft over the last few days of walking on nearly-level ground. This\nclimb was rough, and I had to stop often in order to catch my breath. But we\nwere getting really high up, and I love being high up in the mountains. The\ngreen vegetation of the forest gave way to rocky barren mountainsides, and snow\npatches were all around us.\n\nOddly enough, even though I had to stop quite often to catch my breath, it only\ntook about 90 minutes from when we left Los Perros to get to the top of the pass.\nLaid out before us was a white majesty of a glaciar. It was massive! This was my\nfirst time seeing one from up high, and up close. We spent over an hour up top,\njust gazing out over this majestic creation of nature.\n\nThe climb down was harder. The glacier remained in view for the rest of the day\nas we zig-zagged down switchbacks, and skirted along narrow paths cut into the\nrock. After crossing a long suspension bridge it was time to start taking\nseveral dozen switchbacks down through the forest on the other side of the\nridge we had just summitted. The thickness of the trees created a stuffy feeling\nthat motivated me to practically run down the trail in order to get out of them\nas quickly as possible. Once down and back on flat ground, I power-walked\ntowards Refugio Grey, thinking I had fallen behind the others who had headed\ndown off of the ridge before me. Along the way I passed by some scat which only\nhelped to quicken my pace, given that Pumas and other wild cats lived in the\narea.\n\nGrey had a nice field for setting up tents, and an even nicer refuge for hanging\nout at: they had adirondack-style lounging chairs out front, which is where\nI ate my dinner, while watching the sun go down upon the mountains.\n\n";
