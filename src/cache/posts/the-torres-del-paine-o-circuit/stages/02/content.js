The sun was shining bright, the sky was full of\npink-white clouds, and the tall grasses around me were bright and golden as I\nexited from my tent. The others were already awake and/or slowly rising as well,\nwhich meant it was time to make some oatmeal for breakfast, and start packing up.\n\nIt felt like we walked through those golden-bright fields of grain forever this\nmorning. It sure was a sight to behold. But all good things must come to an end,\nand we started to hike up and up until we were overlooking a large lake below.\nThe wind had also picked up at the top of the hill we had just climbed and was\nblowing everyones hair all over the place. Ugh, but who could complain; these\nviews!\n\nOn the other side of the hill the wind was less intense as we walked through\nwoods made of short round pine trees, and some others that had been through a\nforest fire in years passed. A large tourquise river flowed nearby, but luckily\nwe didn't have to worry about crossing it, or walking alongside it. There was a\ncheckpoint in the woods that the trail went by where we had to get our permits\nchecked, in order to ensure we were authorized to be there. No issues, and on\nwe went.\n\nPine trees gave way to yellow grains which gave way to dark green flora. We could\nalso see snow-capped mountains in the distance, as we steadily walked in their\ndirection. We came upon some marshy lands, and thankfully there was a well-\nmaintained boardwalk going through them. If that wasn't there, this would have\nbeen a very different kind of day.\n\nAfter about 30 minutes we left the marshes behind and we greeted with our first\nsights of Dickson, our refugio for the night. It sat on the shores of a large\nlake, encircled by trees and had a large field where we could pitch our tents if\nwe wanted to, however; nature is a fast teacher. Given the experience we all had\nlast night from the wind, we all choose spots near the treeline, or behind tall\nbushes, so that we would be protected from any future gale-force winds.\n\nThe refugio had a full indoor kitchen within which to cook our meals, as well as\nhot showers and full bathrooms. The best feature about this place though, was\nthe shoreline and rocky beach behind it. I walked up and down it, snapping photos\nof the monsterous mountains that lined the shores on the other side from us,\nand some of them were actually in Argentina, that's how close to the border we\nwere!\n\n";
