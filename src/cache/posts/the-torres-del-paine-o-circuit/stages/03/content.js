The ground was a little muddy,\nbut that's alright. I had brought a thin, cheap, groundsheet with me and after\nusing it last night it was already a mess and had to be tossed, but it turns out\nI wouldn't need it for the rest of the trip.\n\nMost of the morning would be spent walking up and down hilly land through\nforests with the occasional lookout point here and there. There were a few river\nrossings aided by wooden bridges, nothing too crazy. I thought the trail was\ngoing towards the mountains in the distance, but instead it took a right turn\nafter exiting the woods and we started to hike up a rocky trail.\n\nThe real treat today would be the morraine and glaciar along the way, just\nbefore reaching Los Perros (our place for the night). It was a detour from the\nmain route, so not many people chose to go there, which means we had it mostly\nto ourselves. It reminded me of the glacier that I hiked to when I first visited\nSantiago, Chile in 2016. We waded in as far as we dared in the ice-cold waters,\nand lay out on the rocks for a little while, soaking up some sun. Eventually we\nhad to leave and check-in at the campground in order to secure some good sites.\n\nLos Perros campground was mostly in the woods, with all of the sites being in\nmuddy areas. We chose the dryest, and safest (always check for window-makers in\nthe trees above you), looking spots and set up our tents. More modern convenicnes\nat this place as well: hot showers, bathrooms, kitchen to cook in. But it was\nslightly more buggy than the last two places (probably all of the trees). There\nwas a river nearby where we could fill up our water, after filtering it of course.\n\nI grabbed my book and headed out to a grassy area outside of the campground and\nlaid out under the sun and read for a bit. Self-entertainment during the period\nof downtime between setting up camp and waiting to make dinner was a requirement.\nSome read, others took naps, and others chatted. So far not a bad three days of\nhiking!\n\n";
