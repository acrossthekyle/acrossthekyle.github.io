Today would be a short day\nin terms of hiking, but would give us extra time to do a little side-hike\nover to a place that had some amazing views of the mountain that dominated\nthe place we were staying at tonight.\n\nThis mornings trek took us through some old bleached trees that were the victims\nof a forest fire some years ago (the reason we had to watch that mandatory video\nbefore getting our thru-hike permits). Purple flowers were growing all around\nthem, which gave a nice contrast of colors.\n\nThe trail went along the lake created by the melting of Greys Glacier, and\nlittle icebergs could be seen floating in the waters. The glacier itself was\nstill visible in the distance for a while, until we took a turn and it was\nlost to sight for the rest of the day.\n\nAll along the trail today were trees permanently bent into the winds, having\ngrown that way over the years. What an interesting sight, indeed. Todays trail\nwas mostly rocky, with little cover from the sun. If only there hadn't been\nthat forest fire...\n\nWe passed through a cut in the rock and descended down a small valley as we\ncame upon Paine Grande. There was a lovely lake nearby, and a small side-trek\nthat we decided to check out after setting our tents up. I choose a flat grassy\nspot for mine, while others chose to pitch along the edges of the field near\nrocky outcropings or bushes. There were even fences set up at right angles\nthroughout the field for tents, which should have given me a clue about how\nmuch wind this place receves. Sadly, I didn't pick up on it.\n\nThe side-trek took us out onto part of the \"O\" Circuit called The \"Q\", and from\nhere we sat in the grass and gazed out of the lake and the pointy mountain\nnext to the campsite. The waters were nice and cold, and shallow as well, and we\nspent some time going far out into them. We were there for maybe a couple of hours\nbefore we decided to head back. By this time the winds had picked up, and\nour tents at the campsite were holding their own against it, but you could tell\nthat it was going to be a windy night.\n\n";
