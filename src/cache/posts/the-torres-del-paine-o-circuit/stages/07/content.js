export const content = "\n<Stats />\n\n<Route />\n\nToday would be an amazing day of walking along sandy and stony beaches (not\nsomething I had expected to run into down here), and through grassy fields. We\nwould be making for Refuge Chileno, which is part of the \"W\" portion of the \"O\"\nCircuit, and the base of operations for anyone who wanted to hike to the Towers.\n\nI saw some water spouts as we hiked along the beaches. This whole trek has been\nnothing but amazing views! After about 90 minutes of walking it was time to\nleave the water behind and head back into familiar looking territory, seeing as\nwe walked through this same area about a week ago when we set out from the\nwelcome center.\n\nThere were a lot of day hikers on the trail today, which threw us off for a\nmoment because we had gotten used to wide open trails and low traffic over the\npast several days. Nonetheless, I was very nostalgic as this was the same\nroute I had day-hiked 4 years ago, nearly to the day. It brought back so many\nmemories, and things felt so familiar to me.\n\nFor this refuge I had booked a bunk bed because I was finishing the trek a day\nearlier than I had previously planned. It was a welcomed treat after having\ncamped for the past six days. I did not purchase the dinner though, and made\nmy own backpacking meal (my last). I was not alone though as others had also\nnot purchased the meal, but I wish I had (it looked so delicious).\n\nWe went to bed early tonight because we were waking up at around 3 am in order\nto hike up to the towers in the dark in order to watch the sun rise over them.\n\n";
