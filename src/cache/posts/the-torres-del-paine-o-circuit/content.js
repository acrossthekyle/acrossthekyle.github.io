Because it\nwas my first introduction to the world of backpacking, it always held a special\nplace in my heart, and who doesn't like being able to go someplace nostalgic?\n\nI went at the end of February in 2020, just as COVID-19 was beginning to make\nheadlines. And you might also be thinking \"end of February, isn't it snowing?\",\nand no it was not since in the southern hemisphere our winter in the north is\ntheir summer, albiet I went towards the end of their summer.\n\n## What is the \"O\" Circuit\n\nThere are two trekking routes (or circuits) in Torres del Paine National Park:\nthe \"W\" and the \"O\". Both routes get their names from each trailâ€™s layout. The\n\"O\" is a route that runs the entire perimeter of the park, and ends at the same\nplace it starts. Whereas the \"W\" starts at the left-hand side of the park,\nbumps into the middle of it at the Towers, and then ends at the right-hand side\nof the park.\n\nA highlight of the \"O\" circuit is Grey's Glacier. And the circuit itself\nattracts hundreds of travelers from different corners of the planet each year.\nThe route is roughly 85 miles in length and it took me 8 days to complete it.\nIt's a longer distance than the \"W\" and therefore feels more intimate with\nnature because it has fewer hikers on it, but still plenty to make friends!\n\n<World\n  markers={[\n    {\n      left: '25.8%',\n      top: '94.5%',\n    },\n  ]}\n/>\n\n## Where I spent each night\n\nThis trek was different from the others I had done up until this point due to\nthe primary mode of accomodation being a tent! Yes some beds were available in\ndormitories at each daily stopping point, but they were much more expensive. I\nhad never done a backpacking trip before that required a tent, so I bought one\nthat was rated for strong winds and heavy rain (common things in Patagonia), as\nwell as one that utilized my trekking poles in order to hold it up so that I\ncould save on weight.\n\n<Gallery images={['2020/02/18/ac067dfb-eb0c-4a6b-97c2-0863b6ceed93.jpeg']} title=\"My tent for Patagonia at Seron\" />\n\nEach stopping point had a Refugio, provided a kitchen to cook in, and meals for\nthose who were staying in the dormitories. on this particular trek I decided to\nbring all of my food with me (a common thing on the \"O\"). Combine this with all\nof the camping gear and my bag must have weird close to 35 pounds at the start!\n\n## What I brought\n\nIn addition to having a waterproof and strong tent, I also needed to bring a\nthick and comfortable sleeping pad as well as the same warm sleeping bag that\nI had brought with me on the Annapurna Circuit. Always bring a water filter, and\na large power bank is a must due to the remoteness of these Refugios. While it\nnever rained during the day, a good rain jacket is also a must.\n\n<Checklist\n  items={[\n    'A strong tent',\n    'Warm sleeping bag',\n    'Thick sleeping pad',\n    'Large power bank',\n    'Pillow',\n    'Water filter',\n    'Trekking poles',\n    'Entertainment',\n    'Warm fleece',\n    'Down jacket',\n    'Good rain jacket',\n  ]}\n/>\n\n## Stages that I followed\n\nDue to the limited number of places to stay on this trek (there were only 9), I\nhad to book everything in advance which meant locking in how far I could go each\nday. Not something I'm a fan of.\n\n<Stages />\n\nI had a great time on this trip, and it was just the right amount of rustic and\nmodern comforts mixed together. The tent performed very well, although one of my\ntrekking poles did bend in some hurricane-force winds at Paine Grande (everyone\nhad a rough sleepless night that day, along with some sort of tent damange).\n\nWith another type of trek under my belt, I was ready to plan the next hike, but\nthat would have to wait another two years because of COVID-19, and lockdown.\n\n";
