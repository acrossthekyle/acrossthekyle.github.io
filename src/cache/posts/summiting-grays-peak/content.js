export const content = "\n<Stats />\n\n<Route />\n\nToday would be my last 14'er of the trip to Colorado this year, and I chose\nanother popular one in the hopes that I would strike up some friendly conversations\nwhile camping at the trailhead, or whilst at the top. Another reason I chose\nthis particular peak was because the trail started above the treeline! That means\nnot spending two hours hiking through forests, a dream!\n\nAnd sure enough I befriended two women who were camping nearby, in hammocks\nnonetheless. We ate dinner together and hung out for a bit. I would see them\nthe next day near the peak, but this ws the only interaction we would have.\n\nThis was the third peak in as many days, and I was tired. Grays is part of a\ncommon combination route called Grays and Torreys, where you go down a saddle\nridge from the summit of Grays, and then head up to the summit of Torreys, and\nthen come back the way you came. I ended up only doing Grays due to how tired\nI was.\n\n<Gallery images={['2020/09/06/4dd8e416-c1de-4dea-a1ed-8ba58aedf7f8.jpeg']} title=\"Sunrise\" />\n\nI started the trail around 4:30 am, and the initial path across the river near\nthe trailhead went through a valley shaped like an elongated bowl, although\nI would be able to see this until on the way back down give that it was still\nthe pre-dawn hours.\n\nGiven the gently ascending trail and starting at a high altitude to begin with,\nI was already pretty high up after a short amount of time. I paused just in time\nto see a red sun rise over the mountain ridges in the distance, one of my\nall-time favorite things. The trail was starting to get crowded as I continued on.\n\n<Gallery images={['2020/09/06/d71d14df-6498-4ba8-9519-0f6a1f80c218.jpeg']} title=\"Lovely pink skies\" />\n\nAbout 2 and half hours into the trail and I began the ascent to the summit. It\nwas starting to get more steep here, which meant having to take more breaks due\nto my poor beating heart. I'm based in Chicago, so going from sea-level to\n14,000 feet does a number on my body.\n\nLovely pink skies illuminated the world around me as I ascended up and up.\n\nI arrived at the summit by 8:30 am, not bad. Great 360Ëš views all around, as\nusual! I made some friends at the top as we huddled behind a rock wall due to the\nextremely high winds that had picked up within the last half hour. I took a look\nout over the trail I had just hiked. What a view, I just love hiking above\nthe trees!\n\nEverything is so much more green on the way down now that hte sun is up. By\n12:00 pm I get back to the car I left parked at the trailhead, and am ready to\ngo back to another proper campground and reflect on this long weekend of hikes.\n\n";
