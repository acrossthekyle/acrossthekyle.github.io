export const content = "\n<Stats />\n\n<Route />\n\nI decided to take a rest day before attempting Mt. Massive, the second highest\npeak in the state of Colorado, and the third highest peak in the lower 48 states.\nThis would be my longest out-and-back trail at 14.5 miles in total distance. But\nafter Mt. Belford, I was ready for it.\n\nThe initial ascent on this trail was so easy! It felt like a breeze going up,\nbut I know it's an illusion because of the total distance. It's more of a\nmarathon than a sprint, if you will. But truly, the beginning of this trail\nwas easy. However I did get lost at one point thanks to a semi-confusing\ntrail marker, and I had to use my maps app and bushwhack my way back to the\ntrail.\n\nI was making great time due to the ease of the initial ascent, and I was above\nthe treeline with roughly two hours. It was at this point that the trail would\nstart to get a little more difficult due to the presence of switchbacks here. But\nafter getting above the treeline I decided to find a nice rock to sit on and\nwatch the sun rise. As I did I also spotted some cloud inversion in the valley\nbelow, pretty cool stuff. I didn't stay long, maybe 20-39 minutes, because it\nwas actually still pretty cold in this area.\n\n<Gallery images={['2022/09/11/b954a7db-b189-46ef-adf5-745574ed6153.jpeg']} title=\"Hazy fog filling the valley below\" />\n\nAfter moving on my progress was slower than it had been at the beginning. The\ntrail is now starting to get higher and higher, and the steepness is increasing.\nAbout four hours in and I am now at the part in the trail where it really starts\nto climb. It's a bit tricky at this point: there's lots of tricky parts to climb\nand maneuver around, some them scary with big drops off to the side.\n\nWith frequent breaks I slowly make my way up. I can now see Mt. Elbert in\nthe distance as it's practically right next door to this peak. I finally make\nit to the ridge, and it's a long one. Maybe a mile still to go, and I'm losing\nenergy faster than I thought on this mostly gentle trail. After 5 hours I'm at\nthe top, but I didn't stay long. It wasn't too cold, just really really windy,\nand I have a long way down.\n\n<Gallery images={['2022/09/11/5c009cca-ee3f-4f3f-91ea-1806951c7442.jpeg']} title=\"The peak in the distance\" />\n\nThe descent on this mountain was much easier than the ascent. It's never fun\nthought when I get back to the treeline and have to hike through forests for the\nlast couple of hours. It always feels hot and stuffy to me.\n\nIt felt like it took forever to get through those trees, but I finally make it\nback down the car! Wow, what a long trail, but it was a very nice one when\ncompared to Mt. Belford from the other day. This was a good way to end the trip!\n\n";
