It would\ntake almost a year before I worked up the courage to go on a solo vacation in\nthe States and attempt to summit one.\n\nAfter doing a good amount of research on what to bring with me while on the\ntrail to the summit, where to stay, and transportation logistics I booked my\nflights, reserved an AirBnb in Denver, and set out with mixed feelings. I was\nexcited to be going, but nervous since I didn't know what to expect from the\ntrail itself. This trip was also a test of my physical endurance to see how well\nmy body handled being above 10,000 feet, which is when Acute Mountain Sickness\n(or AMS) sets in, and it can definitely be a mood-killer, literally. If I\ncouldn't do this, then I would have to cancel my Annapurna trip that I had booked\nfor a couple of months from now, since those elevations go above 18,000 feet.\n\nOf all the mountain peaks available, of which there are more than 50 above\n14,000 feet, I chose Mt. Elbert as my first. It was the tallest in the state of\nColorado, because I figured go big or go home right? If you're going to do it,\nmight as well do the biggest one first. I was too excited the night before doing\nit and I didn't get my sleep.\n\nI left Denver around 2:00 am for the two and a half hour drive out to Mt. Elbert.\nThe roads were empty as I tuned into the only radio station that worked all the\nway there: an 80's retro station. I hadn't given much thought to the car that I\nhad rented, but it made it up and down and up the mountain highways. The road\nleading to the trailhead was full of potholes, some pretty deep, and it was a\nrough ride but the car made it.\n\nIt was about 4:30 am when I arrived at the trailhead. Thankfully I wasn't the\nonly one here, and several other people were gettign ready and heading out\nahead of me. The parking sure was filling up fast. Must be a popular trail.\n\n<Gallery images={['2019/08/31/b6ed1cce-719a-4bef-b76e-c662f118a7a1.jpeg']} title=\"Making my way up the mountain\" />\n\nI suited up, locked the car, and set out from the trailhead. Right away I could\ntell that I was going to be hurting by the end of this. The trail up through\nthe woods lasted about two hours before leaving the trees behind. It was rough,\nnot because of technicality, but because of the elevation. I had to stop often\nto catch my breath, and I was breathing very heavily. But no signs of AMS, so\nI kept going.\n\nWorried about bears I kept checking left and right, and behind me,\na lot. I was alone in the dark for a good portion of it, and anytime I saw a\nheadlamp light in the distance I felt better knowing there were others nearby.\n\nLuckily I made it above the treeline just in time to catch the sunrise. This\nwasn't my first time seeing a sunrise in the mountains, but it's still magical\nevery time. I enjoyed this peaceful moment for as long as I could, and snacked\non some protein bars.\n\n<Gallery images={['2019/08/31/69d3f9c0-b0b1-4caf-9b8b-96d309924912.jpeg']} title=\"A massive cairn\" />\n\nThe ascent ahead of me was going to be rough, and going to take a while. I knew\nthis peak had multiple false summits, but that didn't stop me from getting my\nhopes up everytime I thought I saw the top. As I went I had to stop every 30-60\nseconds in order to let my heartrate go down, and to catch my breath.\n\nEven when I could see the true summit I had to pause before reaching it. I made\nit to the top around 10:00 am. This was my first time truly being very high up,\n and the 360Ëš views did not dissapoint. I was overjoyed with having conquered\n this obstacle, and it was a great feeling to know that I could do it!\n\n Sadly I didn't feel any kinship with anyone at the top as they were in their\n own groups, so I hung out for about 30 minutes as I ate my lunch I had put\n together the night before. By 10:30 am it was time to start heading down in\n order to avoid afternoon thunderstorms that people in online forums had\n warned about.\n\n I could see the trail laid out ahead of me and it made me feel so small. Going\n through the trees once more wasn't the best part because I was so tired and\n hungry, and the trees seemed to last forever. It didn't seem this bad on the\n way up in the dark... Plus with the rising temperatures it was starting to feel\n much more stuffy and claustrophic while powering down the trail through these\n trees.\n\n It would take about 4 hours before I got back to the car at the trailhead.\n Exhausted, I got in and prepared for the 2.5 hour drive back to Denver. I made\n pasta for dinner and then collapsed into bed knowing I would have to get up\n early again tomorrow morning in order to attempt my next summit: Quandary Peak.\n\n";
