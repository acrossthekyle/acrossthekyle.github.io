We walked along\n\"The Wall\", as I've come to call it, for a brief period of time before\nentering a gathering of small pine trees. Soon after we exited into a cleared\nvalley and up ahead we sawa big ole herd of cows.\n\nThese cows could care less about us, which was good considering my last cow\nencounter resulted in me nearly having a heart attack and probably scaring that\ncow half to death. We walked with them, or rather they walked with us, passed\nsome stone ruins (probably an old herders home) up until a small wire fence\nblocked them from going any further, and we were on our own again.\n\n<Gallery images={['2019/07/16/453a0f85-84f9-4474-9c97-914e435e0f66.jpeg','2019/07/16/4041b310-ae46-4931-b194-75ceb54e0ea2.jpeg','2019/07/16/c0e32575-c736-46d6-a2ea-be3c2d44773a.jpeg']} title=\"Cows joining us on our walk today past some ruins\" />\n\nAnother pine forest awaited us, tucked within spires of mountains that looked\nlike chimney stacks. Ahead I saw a waterfall turning into a river that went off\ninto the distance, but we ended up crossing over the top of the waterfall, instead\nof below it. Shame, that would have made for some good photo-ops.\n\nIt took us maybe an hour to get through the main forest part, and then the trail\nstarted to ascent towards the face of the mountains that were surrounding this\narea. Within the nooks and crannys of them I could see huge piles of snow\nhiding in the shadows and trying to hold out for as long as it could.\n\nEventually the trail came to a bend around the mountain side, and we passed\nthrough a little gap that reminded me of the Lord of the Rings. We met a new\ntravelling companion here who was also German, and was doing a much longer\ntrek through the Alpes and Dolomites which shared part of its trail with the\nAlta Via 1.\n\nAfter this bend in the trail it was finally time to start descending, and it was\na beautiful descent through a decidious forest that had plenty of stumps and\nrocks strewn about, plus some wooden benches for sitting on. I took a break here\n(I had pulled ahead of everyone else during the descent), and as a sat there a\nbutterfly came and rested on my backpack.\n\n<Gallery images={['2019/07/16/90acc05d-f8c3-42ce-a710-fad09e3a7e94.jpeg','2019/07/16/a9485006-b33d-4dbf-8238-dda5a50b03af.jpeg','2019/07/16/625b1a8a-e15e-49be-91c3-b715a3fc01c7.jpeg']} title=\"Walking along the face of the chimney-stack-like mountains\" />\n\nThe others eventually caught up and we all chilled for a bit. It wasn't much\nfurther now until our next resting point: Rifugio Carestiato. It was perched on\na rocky outcrop that provided a very nice view of a valley below us, and the\nclouds flowing past the mountains in the distance. The presence of the forest\nmeant there weren't many areas for exploring around the rifugio, so it was a\npretty calm evening full of drinking and playing cards and eating.\n\n";
