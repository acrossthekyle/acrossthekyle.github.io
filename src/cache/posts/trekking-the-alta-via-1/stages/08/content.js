The trail today was a\nnice mixture of forests, ascending and cross cols between mountain tops, and\npassing what I can only presume are old military barracks built of stone.\n\nWe started off through the trees after leaving the rifugio and walking across\ngrassy fields which offered some amazing views, but shortly there-after we had\nto walk on a road as we descended. Luckily the trail didn't hang out on the road\nfor long and we were back in the trees. Saw some cool looking ruins in there as\nwell.\n\n<Gallery images={['2019/07/16/8a03686b-2d52-45b5-9910-8daab44b8a75.jpeg','2019/07/16/b087112b-5e7a-48c7-a38a-7c4c2f1146a5.jpeg']} title=\"Morning views\" />\n\nThe woods left us behind as the trail took a turn and the vegetation gradually\nthinned out as we headed onto some exposed scree fields. More great views\nthough! But it sure was hot today without the trees or clouds to block the sun.\nAfter a while of going across the scree field, and through more small pine trees,\nwe came to a grassy clearing that had an old hut with a water trough that was\nstill working. We filled up our bottles and kept moving.\n\n<Gallery images={['2019/07/16/14f47581-3412-424b-852b-975b96501af1.jpeg']} title=\"Scree trail\" />\n\nOur views today mostly consisted of mountains in the distance, and small\npine tree forests. But as we came around a bend in the trail after going through\nsome bushes and other vegetation we came across some pretty neat looking stone\nruines. They looked too big to be someones old home, so my guess is that they\nwere left overs from World War II. I tried to explore them as much as possible\nbut the vegetation within had grown too thick.\n\n<Gallery images={['2019/07/16/39e795c1-ead3-4f74-b9d2-d0878c0c9e10.jpeg','2019/07/16/e841d9f1-ec38-48fb-a323-dd7ade4987f7.jpeg','2019/07/16/937f5706-7d9f-4543-b61f-32de1ea0026d.jpeg']} title=\"Some old World War II ruins\" />\n\nAfterwards the trail took us to a crest with some nice views, and then narrowed\nas it turned down into a pine tree and bush forest. I remember racing through\nthis area because of the heat and the smell of pine was overwhelming. Rifugio\nPramperet was also visible in the distance, and I was craving a shower, and\nsome lunch. The dormitories were set along one wall with a courtyard in the\nmiddle, a nice spot for eating outside.\n\n<Gallery images={['2019/07/16/745774d0-d381-4758-8fd6-94f22aa4ff31.jpeg','2019/07/16/f12cf774-954e-4de9-b8b0-24b09d6da5a0.jpeg']} title=\"The rifugio is within reach\" />\n\nThe front balcony had lots of tables with umbrellas, and the inner dining hall\nwas a good size as well. A special after-dinner treat (which the dinner itself\nwas amazing, as they all have been on this trek) involved a Moose coming to\nvisit us! It didn't get very close, but close enough for us to see pretty well.\nWe also watched the sun set behind the mountains.\n\n";
