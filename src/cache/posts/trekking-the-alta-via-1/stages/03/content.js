Today\nwas a bit overcast but the sun was still shining brightly through it.\n\nThe trail took us away from the lake/pond and into the woods. It gained\nelevation quickly, and before long we were up and above trees. Good timing as\nwell since a little bit of cloud inversion was beginning to move in. The path\nleft the trees behind and we were once again walking through rolling green\nhills littered with rocks of all shapes and sizes.\n\n<Gallery images={['2019/07/16/3e50a8ee-7719-4d25-a47e-a79cfafea907.jpeg','2019/07/16/5f2f43c2-ed7c-4011-8d5c-55cb398ccc9d.jpeg']} title=\"Some cloud inversion creeping in\" />\n\nOur group was 6 strong today: Myself and my friend Cerstin, along with two\nmother-daughter pairs from the States. We kept the same pace mostly, but\neventually one of the mother-daughter duos had some extra gas in the tank on an\nascent later on and took off.\n\nWe passed lakes, empty cattle pens, crossed rivers, and skirted around massive\nboulders strewn about the land. At some point we happened upon a cave in the\nmiddle of the rock face, but upon further investigation it appeard to be nothing\nspectacular. Onwards we marched towards what seemed like the edge of the world\nin the distance.\n\n<Gallery images={['2019/07/16/b70d26cc-296b-4c4a-bedd-b211085a8093.jpeg','2019/07/16/95d3e3ae-c1f2-48ee-b82a-7c7ad97600f6.jpeg','2019/07/16/1c4b5221-7aeb-401c-a988-e312d7b9bec6.jpeg']} title=\"Strolling along amongst boulders\" />\n\nBefore us, on either side, rose great walls of rock divided in the middle by a\nforested valley. At the edge of this forested valley there appeared to be a\nmassive drop off, which usually meant steep decline (not so great for the knees).\nHowever, we first had to climb up the left side of this valley before we could\nmake our descent. It took us about an hour of huffing and puffing to make it up\nto the top. There was still snow up there!\n\nOnce at the top we were able to see the path drop off and head down some\nsteep-looking switchbacks towards a lake below. From our point of view it looked\nas if it was a straight drop down, which didn't seem fun. Thankfully, it wasn't\nthat bad. The visibility up there was amazing though: we could see the trail\nfor tomorrow stretch out in front of us.\n\nOn the way down, as we approached the lake from above, a true wall of rock rose\nup to our left, and it dominated the local landscape. At the end of this wall it\nseemed that the world once again just dropped off.\n\n<Gallery images={['2019/07/16/ce29885f-5103-44b9-918e-2a8eea6a8e3f.jpeg','2019/07/16/53d5d22c-b95d-404d-a0ab-584179fe28b2.jpeg','2019/07/16/404b3061-1185-4afa-b5d9-d08020382b99.jpeg']} title=\"A big descent down to the lake along the rocky wall\" />\n\nWe took a break at the lake in order to dip our feet in and pose for some photos.\nWe weren't alone at this lake though, because a field trip full of kids was\neverywhere. That's one thing I've noticed about this trek so far: it's very\naccessible, you can practically drive to any point on it if you wanted. It wasn't\na very \"remote\" hike, not like the Tour du Mont Blanc at least.\n\nThere were some stone ruins just beyond the lake, which I always love checking\nout. And our place for the night was visible in the distance, even if we had to\ngo down a big chunk. There was a nice wide river/waterfall that paralleled the\ntrail as we descended, which meant a great chance to get some fresh (filtered of\ncourse) water.\n\nSome ruined World War II barracks and ammunition depots met us at the bottom of\nour descent as we made our approach to Rifugio Scotoni. This was a nice little\nplace with comfortable rooms with a view, and a nice patio where we would have\ndinner later on. Clouds and rain moved in during the late afternoon, which\ngave us all a good excuse to chill and nap.\n\nAmazing views of the stars at night from here! We had some beers on the patio at\nnight and watched them go by for a bit.\n\n";
