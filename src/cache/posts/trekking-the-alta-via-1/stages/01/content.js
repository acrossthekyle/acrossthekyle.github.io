The\nbus was filled with the backpacks of other hikers, and we had to stand as we\nmade our way along the road. The shuttle dropped us off in front of a hotel on\nthe lake, an idyllic starting point.\n\nLago Brais is an Instagram-worthy location, with a beautiful turqouise mountain\nlake laying at the feet of majestic white-gray mountains. There was a little\ndock with a small shack at the end of it, and a line of old wood canoes all\ntied up. We explored as much of the lake as we could, but it was too big to go\nall the way around, and we had some hiking to do.\n\nThe trail follows along the lake for some time, staying on mostly level ground\nand not gaining any real elevation. The real trail, and ascent into the\nmountains, awaited us when we got to the other end. Loose fallen rocks awaited\nus underfoot as we turned away from the lake and began our trek south.\n\n<Gallery images={['2019/07/16/44fbbcb9-7068-4511-ad14-43b8921ccff3.jpeg']} title=\"Views from above the lake\" />\n\nOnce we started heading up, the incline steadily increaseed, and before\nlong we were already taking breaks to catch our breath. Up and up we went along\nwell-marked trails, stealing glances back at the lake as a way of judging how\nfar we had gone, and how high up we were getting. About an hour later the lake\nwas out of sight, and we were surrounded by mountains.\n\nThere were some pretty sweet views at the top of the initial ascent. Rolling\nhills made of pushed up rock from tectonic forces filled our fields of view. I\nhad never seen such interesting rock formations. Some looked like regular\nmountains, while others looked as if someone pushed a mountain onto its side and\nthen smoothed it out. They were extending into the sky at all sorts of odd angles.\nSome even looked like they had their tops cut off.\n\n<Gallery images={['2019/07/16/e0da476c-1a61-417e-9eea-38590c138634.jpeg']} title=\"Rifugio Bella\" />\n\nMaybe an hour and a half went by of going up and down these interesting rock\nformations before we got our first glimpse below of the place that we would be\nspending the night at: Rifugio Bella. It looked so small when set against the\nbackdrop of these mountains.\n\nBut before we turned to head for the rifugio, we decided to do a side trek up\nthe nearby mountain. About 90 minutes later and we were at the top, and it was\nworth it. It seemed like we covered a lot of distance today, however this was\nnot the case, it was all mostly vertical, because far below us was the Lago\nBrais, the place we had started at, although it was very small from up here.\n\nWe maybe spent close to an hour at the top before the cold wind finally got to us,\nand we started our descent down to the rifugio. An hour later and we were all\nchecked in. The beds were spacious and comfortable, and the dinner was superb!\nAfter dinner we hung out drinking and talking with our new friends! Time flew by\nand before we knew it it was already 9:30 pm. The sun was already beginning to set\n\n<Gallery images={['2019/07/16/5ab978a2-11d3-4640-aab0-5cabe41a4b5d.jpeg']} title=\"Purple skies at sunset\" />\n\nAs the sun was setting, I stepped out of the mountain rifugio. I stood there as\nthe sun set, watching the skies turned a deep purple. As the temperature slowly\ndropped, I stared at the silhoutes of the mountains surrounding me. This is\nwhere I belonged, being in the mountains. As I stood there a little fox went\nscampering by, bringing food back to its den.\n\nWhat a great start to this trek!\n\n";
