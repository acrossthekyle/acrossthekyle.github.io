The trail was coming to an end, but it\nwas too far to go all the way today, so we had booked some beds at a place\ncalled Rifugio Pian de Fontana, our last rifugio of the trip!\n\nWe desended for a short while, but then quickly started ascending towards some\ncols between peaks. The stone was very white in this area, punctuated by dark\ngreen bushes and vegetation. This wasn't an easy climb, lots of stopping to\ncatch my breath. But it felt good to be high up once more, instead of going\nthrough thick forests.\n\nLots of ice fields up top as well, with views for days of the surrounding\nmountains that were wreathed in white clouds. It felt like standing on the\nedge of the world at some points. After about an hour and a half of straight\nascent, we came to the top and took a much deserved break.\n\n<Gallery images={['2019/07/16/442554bf-3d3c-424a-bdeb-0a2272112880.jpeg','2019/07/16/a35bff22-1ec2-49a2-b23d-968e419cc4b5.jpeg','2019/07/16/22c273d1-c79c-4026-8733-15f007d0c853.jpeg']} title=\"Ascending with views\" />\n\nOur route now took us down between two mountain peaks that looked like they had\nbeen split down the middle by lightening, and then pushed open in order to make\na way for us to get through. Another wall of rock though greeted us in the\ndistance and flanked us on our left as we walked. We thought we also spotted\nsome deer, or moose, at the top of the wall but they were too far away for us\nto see, or even be sure. But we did have a lot of marmots to keep us company as\nwe walked through a grassy field full of dandelions.\n\n<Gallery images={['2019/07/16/e7e5c220-ebf8-4eb3-98b7-ce7b9bf4d1d5.jpeg']} title=\"A split mountain\" />\n\nAnother drop-off loomed in the distance, and clouds were starting to roll into\nour area and obscure the path, but they pushed themselves off and into the\ndistance as we approached. The trail at this drop-off was full of switchbacks,\nand it was a long way to go through them all, but eventually we came to the\nbottom and to our place for the night.\n\nSomeone said they spotted Edelweiss on the trail today at the switchbacks, but\nI didn't see any, nor did my friend Cerstin. She was very dissapointed as it's\nrare to spot it in the wild.\n\n<Gallery images={['2019/07/16/8d786299-a25b-4d81-9e0d-1ffed2adaa4d.jpeg']} title=\"Sheep surrounding our rifugio\" />\n\nThe rifugio we were staying at had a herd of sheep surrounding it for most of\nthe afternoon, but they departed just before dinner-time. We enjoyed a lot of\nwine at dinner due to it being our last night on trail, and we shared lots of\nlaughs and stories with our travelling companions.\n\nNight fell and the sky turned all sorts of brilliant pinks and purples. Tomorrow\nwe would be doing a lot of descent and trying to make it to a bus stop in time\nto catch our ride into town, and meet up with another friend from the Camino\nwho lived nearby: Mauro!\n\n";
