We got an early\nstart in order to make sure we had plenty of time to catch that bus, otherwise\nwe would have to figure out another way of getting into town. There was another\ncable car for re-supply at this rifugio, and I thought about taking it down\ninstead of walking.\n\nMost of the first part of the morning was spent going laterally instead of\nvertically. There was an initial descent from the rifugio but then it became a\nstraight shot acoss the mountains before we started going down. I turned back\nfor one last look and the whole area looked like something out of an idyllic\ndream.\n\n<Gallery images={['2019/07/16/08d6d395-2536-471c-8289-535071335bbb.jpeg']} title=\"Cutting across before going down\" />\n\nI was on the hunt for the Edelweiss flower as someone last night had told us\nthis was a good area to spot some. Alas, I did not spot any today. We travelled\nover trails cut into the side of moss and grass-covered mountains. Clouds\nstarted to roll in shortly thereafter. It further increased the dream-like\nquality of the day.\n\nForests started to dominate our view as we left the scraggly tree-less upper\nelevations behind and descended down steep zig-zagging switchbacks. We were\ngoing different speeds so we all spread out and got separated. But about\nhalfway down there was a rifugio that had an open kitchen and, most importantly,\nbathrooms. We ate last nights pie leftovers as a snack. Beforelong we were ready\nto keep going.\n\nAs we went down the sides of the mountains, and the valley we were going down,\nsteepened which allowed for views up and down it's entire width. It was cool to\nbe able to see where we had come from all the way up yonder.\n\n<Gallery images={['2019/07/16/a62fa427-3d84-44bb-9135-1649849c4b3e.jpeg','2019/07/16/82d70c5b-ab9d-4e5b-8fcf-8ed3da0d1877.jpeg']} title=\"Looking back from the forest below\" />\n\nOn the way I spoke with some other hikers who had the GR20 (Grande Randonnee 20)\nin Corsica, France and I asked if I was someone who could do it, given that I had\nread it was the hardest hike in Europe. They said \"Yes, of course! If you can do\nthis hike then you can do that one, it's no different.\" This made me feel more\nconfident about doing it, but sadly it would still be nearly 5 years before I\ndecided to conquer it.\n\nWe finished the thru-hike around 11 am. It was an unceremonious ending,\nit was just a bus stop on a road somewhere after all. But behind the bus stop\narea was a very wide river with a rocky beach, and we took the opportunity to\nditch our backpacks and stick our feet in the cold water. Each one of us nearly\nslipped into the cold water as we tried to venture our into the flowing waters.\n\n<Gallery images={['2019/07/16/86c46d92-7f1c-4d3f-9540-c5e94c8f158b.jpeg','2019/07/16/f963df24-1bdf-4371-b56d-e5b55aa14b62.jpeg','2019/07/16/d4d906d7-1f13-4ce4-8c9f-c36923a0bb94.jpeg']} title=\"Celebrating in the river waiting for the bus to arrive\" />\n\nEventually it was time to regroup, re-shoe, pack up, and head back up to the\nroad as the bus was due to arrive soon. By that time more people had arrived,\nand it was a full bus ride back into civilization.\n\nI really liked this one. It had great food, amazing views, an easy trail,\nand great people with which to enjoy it all. Maybe in the future I'll return\nand try the Alta Via 2!\n\n";
