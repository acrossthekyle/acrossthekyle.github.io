I want to say that it took about an hour and a half in order\nto complete the initial ascent. However long it took, we were so high up that\nwe were walking on snow.\n\nToday had a little bit of everything in terms of landscapes and environments.\nAfter crossing the snowy portions at the beginning there was a bend in the trail\nand we went around a mountainside that was the most red-brown rock/dirt that I\nhave ever seen. It was also littered with anti-avalanche fencing meant to hold\nthe snow back, or at least I think that's what they were for.\n\n<Gallery images={['2019/07/16/c9301d11-8142-40cf-b3b8-c06d10f93fc1.jpeg','2019/07/16/685deefa-4508-4d51-80f5-7075c242bc84.jpeg']} title=\"Snow covering the trail and a confusing junction\" />\n\nOnce we finished going around the bend in the trail, the red-brown rock/dirt\ngave way to white stone and green grasses growing along the mountainside. We\ntook in the views as we continued following the trail markers. Then came a\njunction in the trail, and no one seemed to know which way to go. Even the\npaper maps weren't much of a help. Needless to say, we took a wrong turn.\n\nBut it was a pretty cool wrong turn, simply because we got to walk next to this\nmassive boulder that was just sitting there, almost like it was guarding the\nway. We were also treated to some pretty cool sights of a valley in the\ndistance. We turned around and went back to the junction, and this time took\nthe correct route that took us along a very thin strip of land around the\nbase of a dome-like mountain.\n\nMore interesting looking ruins and caves along the way today as well. In the\ndistance we could see Citta de Fume, and another mountain that looked like\nit had it's head chopped off.\n\n<Gallery images={['2019/07/16/fa5aa147-f685-4491-8954-ca2a1907856b.jpeg']} title=\"Going the wrong way\" />\n\nWhite/gray rock transitioned to green fields as we finished the route along the\nbase of the dome-like mountain and began a series of moderate switchbacks. It's\na good thing I had the knee braces on or else I would have been far worse off.\nWe were met with thick conifer forests at the end of the switchbacks, and the\ntrail took us to a restaurant in the woods with a patio overlooking the tree-\ntops.\n\nIf I haven't already mentioned it, the food on this trek is the best so far, and\nthat's most likely due to the fact that these places are accessible by motor\nvehicles. I know that ruins the remoteness of it, but it does mean each place\nhas a full kitchen and delicious foods to choose from. Case-in-point, I had a\nbeer, salad, and burger with fries topped with an egg at this restaurant. Yum!\n\nThe next two hours, after leaving the restaurant, were filled with walking\nthrough forests, with some fleeting glimpses every now and then of the many\nmountains that were surrounding us, and a couple of road crossings. Finally we\nbegan to ascend out of the forests towards more familiar rocky terrain, and\nour destination for the night: Rifugio Averu.\n\n<Gallery images={['2019/07/16/f343315d-0ea8-42c3-ad05-4434d5eeb9f4.jpeg','2019/07/16/5e45e25c-30b5-4d01-b260-b74ae33a4f7d.jpeg','2019/07/16/440e3873-c14c-4110-912d-a2ec73cd1183.jpeg']} title=\"Glimpses over the trees, crossing roads, and Citta de Fume\" />\n\nAveru stood at the top of a rocky mountain slope with a steep drop-off on the\nother side that provided some great views from the dining hall windows. This\nplace also had the fanciest meals on this trek, complete with hardboiled eggs\nfor breakfast! We definitely stuffed our bellies full at this place. I think I\nactually gained weight on this trek.\n\n";
