export const content = "\n<Stats />\n\n<Route />\n\nBack when I first started looking into international backpacking thru-hikes I\nhad come across a list of the best hikes in the world, and the Alta Via 1 was\none of them. The more I looked, the more it kept appearing on various lists\nrecommending it as a good hike to do if you've already done the TMB.\n\nSo, in February of 2019 I asked a friend from the Camino if they would be\ninterested in joining me on this hike, and they said \"of course\"! They're from\nGermany so it was much easier for them to get there (only a couple of train\nrides).\n\n## What is the Alta Via 1\n\nThe Alta Via 1, or High Route 1, is a roughly 78 mile trail that runs from north\nto south through the Dolomites mountains in northern Italy. As the number 1\nwould suggest, there are many Alta Via's in the Dolomites, each increasing in\ndifficulty as the number gets higher. 1 is the easiest of the routes, with 7\nbeing the hardest, and 1 is the classic high route to do in the Dolomites.\n\n<World\n  markers={[\n    {\n      left: '47.75%',\n      top: '21%',\n    },\n  ]}\n/>\n\nIt passes through some of the finest scenery in the Dolomites. And I must say,\nof the two thru-hikes I had been on so far, this one had the most captivating\nlandscapes due to the varied shapes and colors of the mountains.\n\nIt took me roughly 10 days to finish it, but some people can do it in faster or\nshorter amounts of time. A typical day on the route involves several hours of\nwalking, with ascents and descents of about 3,000 feet per day. As I've come\nto learn with any European trail, the best time to go is the summer, and that's\nexactly when I went: smack dab in the middle in July when it was at it's most\nbusiest.\n\n## Where I spent each night\n\nMuch like Tour du Mont Blanc, the Alta Via 1 employs a series of mountain huts,\nor Rifugios, to stay at. They provide the same accomodations as the TMB:\nmeals, bed to sleep in, and full bathrooms. Each one though is accessible by\nmotor vehicle, so these particular mountain huts are much more luxurious. Truth\nbe told, this thru-hike has had the best meals so far.\n\nI think I actually gained weight on this trek!\n\n<Gallery images={['2019/07/16/822d9b1d-14e7-440f-8184-8e2c595e91a6.jpeg']} title=\"Rifugio Biella\" />\n\nAs with any hut-to-hut hike I had to reserve where I would stay in advance. This\nmeant that some days would be short and easy, with lots of down time, while\nothers would be a longer and more difficult.\n\n<Stages />\n\nWhile this trail is definitely a popular one, it also felt much more public\ngiven the ease of access to the Rifugios, and the trail itself, with multiple\npoints of entry along it. This trail did not feel \"as removed\" from the world\nas the TMB.\n\nThis thru-hike had the most diverse landscapes I have seen up to this point, and\nit had the best meals you could ask for. Combine that with having a good friend\nas my travelling companion and I couldn't go wrong. We also befriened a couple\nof pairs of hikers who had the same schedule as us, and walked with them for\nnearly the whole way.\n\n";
