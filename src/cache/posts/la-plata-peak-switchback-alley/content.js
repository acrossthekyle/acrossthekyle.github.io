Instead I could wake up at 4:00 am to drive 10 minutes.\n\nFor my first 14'er of the year I chose La Plata Peak, named after the numerous\nsilver mines in the area. It wasn't a very long out-and-back trail, but it was\na more technically difficult trail than the two I had done last year. For those\nwho may not know, the different trails that go up to the peaks of mountains\nare given classifications, with 1 being the eastiest, and 5 the hardest. The\ntwo peaks I did last year in Colorado were 1's, while La Plata was more of a 2.\n\nI wild camped about 1.5 miles from the trailhead, down a country road off of the\ncounty highway. I was alone in this area, and the next closest human was\nprobably further down the country road at another wild camping site. But for me,\nwhere I was, it was dead silent. This would be my first time doing something\nlike this, and I was definitely nervous.\n\nAfter a restless night of sleeping (I was on a slight incline but was too tired\nto re-setup the tent) I woke around 3:30 am in order to pack up camp, and\ndrive to the trail head. It was quiet last night, only the sound of the rushing\nwater from the nearby river provided any sort of ambient background noise. I had\ndinner while looking out of the mountain I was now going to attempt to summit.\n\nI prepared some oatmeal at the trailhead in the trunk of the SUV that I had\nrented for this trip. There were about 10 other cars in the parking lot, but\nI didn't see many people on the trail, at least not until the summit.\n\nYet another long trek through a thick forest to start the day. It took about 2\nhours to get through the trees, and when the terrain finally opened up I was\ngreeted with a wall of rock in front of me that was criss-crosed by a ton of\nswitchbacks. I knew I wasn't going to make it up high enough to watch the\nsunrise, so I didn't push myself too hard as I went up.\n\n<Gallery images={['2020/09/04/d609dd99-7b40-4373-8c60-808d218b77a8.jpeg']} title=\"Pink skies with the sun rising\" />\n\nAs I got higher the pink light from the sunrise lit up the mountain tops and it\nlooked like they were covered in snow, but it was early September so this was\nonly an illusion. I may have missed the sunrise but I was able to watch it pour\nover the mountain peaks nearby.\n\nThe view from the top of the switchbacks was very nice, I could start to make\nout different peaks around me instead of being blinded by thick forests. Now\nI began hiking up a saddle ridge towards the col at the base of the summit. I\nsaw lots of new plants that looked strange to me, but I'm sure were plentiful\nat these alpine altitudes.\n\nEarlier I said that there couldn't be any snow at the peaks, but there definitely\nwas some on the ridge I was hiking, albeit hidden in permanent shadow. Far below,\nand in the distance, I spotted a lovely little mountain lake. I don't know why,\nbut I just love how they contrast for rocky world around them.\n\nI made it to the summit by noon, which meant about 6 hours on trail so far. Here\nwere all of the people whos cars were in the parking lot, meaning it was a\ncrowded summit. I lingered for a little bit, eating some food, and taking\npictures, but much like Mt. Elbert I was feeling any sort of socialness from\nthe other people up here so I packed up my things are started my journey down,\nplanning on it taking close to 4 hours to complete.\n\nUnfortunately on the way down I ran out of water, and had to hike without a\nrefill for nearly 2 hours before I came to a river back in the forest. I refilled\nmy water bottles, but couldn't drink it because I thought I had left the filter\nin the car. Turns out, I was wrong, and I had the filter the entire time. Believe\nme I chugged a ton of water when I got back to the car.\n\nI snacked, changed into fresh clothes, and on my way out of the area I found\na much larger river where I could stop and fill up again. I booked a last-minute\ncampground spot on the way, and got a good nights sleep.\n\n";
