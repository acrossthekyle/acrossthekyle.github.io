export const content = "Within the Himalays in Nepal there is an area called the Annapurna Conservancy, which contains the Annapurna Circuit itself. It's a protected area of wilderness, almost like a national park. Entrance is monitored at various checkpoints by Nepalese military, and as a tourist you can only stay within the area for a limited amount of time (usually the amount of time it takes to do the entire circuit).\n\nThe Annapurna Circuit has been voted the best long-distance trek in the\nworld as it combines a wide variety of climate zones from the tropics to the\nArctic, and cultural variety from Hindu villages to the Tibetan culture.\n\n<Stats />\n\n<Route />\n\nThis is another hike that had been on my radar all the way back in 2018 when\nI was first choosing which interntional backpacking trip I wanted to go on. But\ngiven the wide range of elevation changes, and the fact that I had never been\non a mountain hike before, I opted for the flatter and more popular trek, the\nCamino.\n\nHaving done three thru-hikes to date, each within a variety of elevations and\nenvironments, I decided that I was ready to go on an adventure on the other\nside of the planet. It was a 15 hour plane ride from Chicago to China,\nand then a shorter 2 hour flight from there to Nepal.\n\nI thought I was ready for the culture shock, but I was not. Nepal is such a\ndifferent place than what I have previously experienced, and it took a couple of\ndays to get used to it. However, I didn't have much time since I would be\nstarting the trek the very next day!\n\nAfter losing a North Face fleece in the domestic flights terminal (if you can\ncall it that) at the Khatmandu airport, and a short one-hour propeller plane\nride to Pokhara, I had finally arrived. Pokhara is the outdoor enthusiast place\nto be in Nepal due to its central location to the Himalays and other areas, and\nwas to be my homebase while I was out in the mountains.\n\n## What is the Annapurna Circuit\n\nThe Annapurna Circuit is a circular route that goes around the Annapurna Mountain (one of the eight tallest peaks in the world). The trail gets it start in the subtropical forests along paddy fields and waterfalls at 2,500 feet, and ascends all the way up to the frozen Arctic region at 17,800 feet reaching the Tibetan plateau.\n\nThe whole circuit is about 145 miles in length, and it took me 13 days to\ncomplete it, even with some side treks mixed in. I went in a counter-clockwise\ndirection because this way the daily altitude gain was slower, and it makes\ncrossing the highest point easier and safer.\n\n<World\n  markers={[\n    {\n      left: '71.3%',\n      top: '32%',\n    },\n  ]}\n/>\n\n## Where I spent each night\n\nThis trek was similar to the Camino de Santiago in terms of accommodations.\nAlong the trail there are several small villages, each providing a handful of\noptions to spend the night. The places to spend each night where called Tea\nHouses, and when you arrived you would ask how many beds were available, and\nthen (the fun part) you start negotiating the price.\n\nIf you were a solo traveler, you probably didn't have much negotiating power.\nBut, if you were part of a group (like I was) then you had some sway. You could,\nfor example, offer to stay two nights at a discounted rate. And if you agreed to\neat there, which you aren't required to do, you could get an even more\ndiscounted rate.\n\nYou could potentially talk them down from $20 a night (before including meals)\nto $10 a night! For a budget-concious traveler, this is a big win. On our first\nnight we were able to share a room with three beds and a cot (since we were a\ngroup of four), and told them we would eat there. This brought it down to about\n$2 per person for the night.\n\n<Gallery images={['2019/10/19/cb3e04f9-d822-4c8c-b688-072fda9aca74.jpeg']} title=\"Upper Pisang\" />\n\n## What I brought\n\nSeeing as this was my fourth thru-hike you would think that I would have made\nsome gear changes by now, especially since this type of trek is something I had\nnot done before, right? Wrong. I used the same gear from the Tour du Mont Blanc,\nbut with some other gear thrown in that I already had lying around. Here are\nsome essentials though:\n\n<Checklist\n  items={[\n    'Sleeping bag',\n    'Sleeping bag liner',\n    'Large power bank',\n    'Pillow',\n    'Hut slippers',\n    'Water filter',\n    'Chlorine tablets',\n    'Trekking poles',\n    'Entertainment',\n    'Warm fleece',\n    'Down jacket',\n  ]}\n/>\n\nYou go from a very warm climate to very cold climate in about a week, so you\nneed to be prepared for both. This means both a bag liner for the warmer areas,\nand a warm sleeping bag for the colder ones. A large power bank is necessary\nsince electricity might not always be available as you get higher up, and there\nare also frequent blackouts in the mountain villages.\n\nMuch like the Camino you didn't have to reserve anything in advance, which is\nnice. I like having the freedom to be able to go for as long as I want in a day.\nHaving said that, there are some areas where it's not recommend you push\nyourself to go too far.\n\n<Stages />\n\n";
