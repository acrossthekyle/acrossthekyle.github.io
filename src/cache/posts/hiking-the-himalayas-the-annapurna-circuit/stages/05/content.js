The sun was already high in the sky as\nwe walked high above the same fast-flowing river that has been with us since the\nbeginning. As we left we passed a monumen to Buddha saying \"Buddha was born in\nNepal\".\n\nStarting to see a lot of porters on trail today, probably from those who chose\nto take a jeep up to the village last night. These poor folks are carrying\nmultiple large bags on their backs while walking in sandals. They're not getting\npaid enough to do this.\n\nPassed another Buddha monument around a bend in the mountain trail saying the\nsame thing: born in Nepal. This part of the trail was most definitely blasted\nout of the vertical wall of rock that we were walking alongside. We also had to\nshare the trail today with lots of jeeps and motorbikes. Even though we had to\nshare the trail, at least it was nice and wide.\n\n<Gallery images={['2019/10/19/6b391a0f-e20f-4aab-9697-01705d97124f.jpeg','2019/10/19/6ac29846-5d4c-4967-b985-55d3932c0ea2.jpeg']} title=\"Fewer trees, more mountains\" />\n\nThe views though, they are starting to get pretty awesome-looking. The trees are\nbecoming fewer, and the mountains greater. From here we can actually see the\nAnnapurna Massif.\n\n<Gallery images={['2019/10/19/ba156e52-edfd-4a02-99c3-31187ce5da9e.jpeg']} title=\"Ceiling of a buddhist temple\" />\n\nOur destination today was Upper Pisang, as opposed to Lower Pisang. We made it\nin due time, and found a lovely place with a view to stay at. In Upper Pisang\nthere is also a buddhist temple that we could go to, and we didn't pass up\nthe opportunity. We're also high enough now that we need our puffy jackets to\ngo walking around in the afternoon. I have never seen so many colors in one\nbuilding before. This buddhist temple was a joy for the eyes.\n\n";
