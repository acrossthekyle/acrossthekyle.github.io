export const content = "\n<Stats />\n\n<Route />\n\nThe two remaining members of our group, Veronique and myself, set out from\nMarpha bound for Ghasa. It would be a mostly dusty trail today, and on part\nof the way we had a dog follow us for some time, hoping for food most likely.\n\nWe walked over bridges, through bright green grassy fields and forests, and\nover many river crossings. Lots of jeeps on todays trail as well. Sadly I lost\none of my flipflops on the way today, not sure where. We also passed through\nsome apple orchards.\n\nMost of the trail was along the road, and there were some places to stop along\nthe way, but most of them were empty and/or run-down. Not much food offerings\neither.\n\nMore walking along riverbeds as well today. We didn't see any other hikers\nuntil we entered the village of Ghasa, and even then it was few and far between.\nIt was feeling very lonely on trail. We found a place to stay and the rooms\nweren't that bad. We each had our own which was nice though, usually not a\ncommon thing on the Annapurna Circuit.\n\n";
