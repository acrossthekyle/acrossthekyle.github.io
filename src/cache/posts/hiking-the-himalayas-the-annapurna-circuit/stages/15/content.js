export const content = "\n<Stats />\n\n<Route />\n\nWell rest, and well fed, I departed Chromwrong the next morning for the ABC trek.\nI wouldn't make it all the way, but I got pretty far on the first day, and\nended up in a place called Deurali.\n\nIt was all up today. Leaving Chomrong meant descending down to the valley floor\nand then heading up the other side, which meant a lot of stress on my knees\nand lungs from all this gain.\n\nMost of the day was spent walking through jungles. About halfway in I found a\nplace for lunch, and ate some more pasta and had more cokes. I continued on\nwithout much of a delay. There was a cool series of caves along the way,\nwith ice/snow bridges hanging over them.\n\nAt the next village it was starting to rain, and would continue to rain all the\nrest of the day. I arrived at Deurali about six hours after starting the trail\ntoday. I got a room shared with two other strangers, and set about hanging up\nmy wet stuff to try and get it to dry out. The showers were nice and hot though!\n\nIn the dining hall I hung out and read, and later ended up joining a group of\nbritish people who were playing card games while eating dinner.\n\nThe next day would be Annapurna Basecamp.\n\n";
