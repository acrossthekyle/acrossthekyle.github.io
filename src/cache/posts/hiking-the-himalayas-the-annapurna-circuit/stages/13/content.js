My original destination for\ntoday was going to be Tatopani, but when we got there it was mostly locals, no\nother hikers, and I would finally be alone since the last member of my group\nwould be catching the bus back to Pokhara. So I decided to follow an Australian\ncouple who were doing the circuit to Ghorepani.\n\nThe way down from Ghasa was fast. We were now within the jungle biome once more,\nand it was getting warm fast. A large river was flowing next to us as\nwe descended down the trail and crossed over suspension bridges. It only took\nabout 2.5-3 hours to get down to Tatopani, the traditional endpoing point of\nthe trek. I debated staying here, and continueing on tomorrow and starting the\nAnnapurna Basecamp trek since I had tons of extra time due to it not taking\nas long as I had thought to do the circuit. But the Australian couple we had met\nlast night at the place we stayed in Ghasa were continuing on today, and since\nit was so early in the day I figured why not keep going?\n\nInitially we were all hiking together, but they were much faster at going up\nand so after a while I told them to go on ahead and that I would meet up with\nthem at the place we had decided upon at lunch in Tatopani.\n\nI was walking alone now, but the trail was well-marked. There were a lot of\nelevation gains happening today, nearly 4,000 feet of it, all since Tatopani.\nI had stopped seeing other hikers on the trail for a while now, and it wasn't\nuntil the sun started to go down that I started to catch up to some who had\nstarted off from other places along this trail.\n\nI hadn't had anything to eat since lunch time, and even then it wasn't much,\nand I was also out of bars to snack on. I had plenty of water though. As the sun\nwent down the temperatures started to drop, but I didn't notice. I was too tired\nand too full of andrenaline to care. I was wheezing by this point though, and\nevery step was a struggle. Eventually I came to the archway that marked the\nentrance to Ghorepani, but the universe was feeling extra cruel that day because\neven though I was \"here\" I still had to ascend several flights of stone stairs\nin order to get to the places to stay.\n\nAs I walking on and up, I came to the place that the Australians and I had earlier\nagreed upon. It was empty. It had been shutdown and shuttered for some time, and\nby the looks of it was not going to open any time soon. This was not good. I could\nsee other places to stay in the distance, more close the center of the village.\nI pushed on and entered the first place that I came to. It was busy, in fact\nthis whole village was bustling with activity from other hikers. Makes sense\nsince there is a day-hike here you can do called Poon Hill.\n\nI stumbled into the building and asked for a room at the front desk. I must have\nbeen in bad shape, or maybe it was because I had arrived so late in the evening,\nbut I got a lot of stares when I entered. The host of the place showed me to a\nroom with a single bed in a building that had some thin walls. I asked them for\nsome snacks to eat (I was starving) and a blanket since I was cold, and then\nthey left. I sat down on the bed and that was when things really started to go\nbad.\n\nNearly instantaneously my arms from my elbows to my hands, and my legs from my\nknees to my feet, started to tingle and go numb. I didn't know what this could\nmean (I thought I was just really tired), and I sat there hoping it would wear\noff and stop on its own. It did not. Nervous, I struggled down the stairs and\nheaded to the front desk asking for a blanket and some snickers bars. They said\nthey would bring one up, so I headed back upstairs with my snickers and sat\non the bed and snacked and waited.\n\nAbout five minutes later they arrived with the blanket. I must have been in\nshock because I told them I couldn't feel my arms and legs and they said that's\nbecause you are cold and need to warm up. I followed them back downstairs and\nthey cleared a spot for me on a bench next to the open fireplace. I wrapped the\nblanket around me and sat their shivering, waiting for the fires to heat me up.\nIf it wasn't for what happened next I probably would have died.\n\nA group of hikers were sitting at a table next to the windows, and one of them\nkept glancing over at me. After a few moments they came over and asked what was\nwrong. I said I was cold and shivering and they asked if I had changed out of\nmy hiking clothes that had been soaked in sweat all day. I said no and they\nasked if I had a change of outfit, to which I said yes. They immediately picked\nme up by the arms and brought me to my room where they helped me change into\ndry clothing. They then grabbed my sleeping bag and brought me back down to\nthe fireplace. He orderd some hot salty soup for me to drink/eat, along with\nmore snickers bars. After eating I laid down on the bench and fell asleep\nnext to the warm fire in my sleeping bad.\n\nA couple of hours later I awoke, in a bit of a daze but doing much better. The\nhiker checked in on me and asked if I was ok. I thanked them immensly, and headed\nupstairs to go to sleep. While laying in bed I used my phone and the teahouses\nwifi and googled my condition. I found out that I had minor hypothermia, and if\nit wasn't for the intervention of those hikers, I would have died.\n\nWords can't describe how I feel about that situation, and what happened. It was\na series of bad decisions, one after the other. I was lucky to be alive.\n\n";
