He had to continue on in order to\nfinish the trek by a certain date, and couldn't take the variant route to\nTilicho Lake with us, which is where we would be spending the night before heading\nup to the worlds highest freshwater lake at 15,500 feet. The three of\nus left Manang, and crossed a suspension bridge out of town in the early\nmorning hours.\n\nMost of the trail today would be going alongside mountain slopes that looked\nlike they had either just had a landslide, or were about to. A couple of times\na supply train of donkeys would cross our path and I got nervous that they\nwould send the stony trail tumbling down. Luckily that never happened.\n\nThis terrain though looked like something from an alien world.\n\nFor nearly 5 hours we marched up and down these slopping hills, gaining altitude\nwith each step. We took a mid-day break at small set of teahouses in a place\ncalled Shree Kharka, and decided to stay here on the way back from Tilicho Lake\nthe following day, instead of pushing all the way for Thorong Phedi. The\nteahouses here are so colorful!\n\nEventually, after a long day of hiking, we arrived at Tilicho Lake Basecamp,\nand found what appeared to be the last places to sleep. There was a catch though:\nthis room for all of us to share was in a small hut behind the main building.\nThis meant thin walls, windows with holes in them, and rough mattresses to sleep\non. It was better than nothing.\n\nThe dinner here was really good though. My body is finally getting used to eating\nnothing but cheap Dal Bhat, and the free refills! We went to bed early tonight\nafter spending all evening hanging out in the dining hall reading and playing cards.\nTomorrow we would be getting up early to do the hike up to the lake.\n";
