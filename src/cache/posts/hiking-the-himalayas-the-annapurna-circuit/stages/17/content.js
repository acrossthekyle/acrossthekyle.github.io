After bundling up in all my layers I headed outside and\nstarted following the others as they headed towards the Annapurna mountain and\nto a large flat area above the refuges for optimal viewing.\n\nI love seeing the sunrise in the mountains, and this one did not dissapoint. Not\na cloud in the sky as it turned from dark blues to bright pinks. The mountains\naround us started to glow golden before we could see the sun rise. Their tips\nlooked like they were on fire as the sun struck them and stirred up the snow\nat their peaks.\n\nAfter being out there for over an hour we all headed back to the dining hall\nfor a nice hot egg breakfast with hot cocoa. I had decided to go all the way\nback down to Chomrong today given that I had nearly gone all the way up to\nBasecamp in almost a single day. Folks that I had dinner with two days prior\nin Chomrong had said it only took them a day as well to come down from Basecamp.\n\nThe first part of the trail was slow going due to the snow that had fallen\nyesterday, and all of the compacted snow underneath that was now as slick as\nice. Probably an hour later and I was out of the snow regions and heading\nthrough bushes and scraggly grasses, passing all of the things I had gone by\nyesterday.\n\nI didn't take many pictures today as I raced down the trail. I was motivated\npartly by thinking of getting a nice room to myself again at the place I had\nstayed at previously in Chomrong, and their awesome pizza, but I was also partly\nmotivated by the fact that there weren't many people coming down or up the trail\ntoday, and I had a slight semi-unrational fear of tigers that lived in the area.\n\nTowards the end of the trail, before the big descent and ascent back up to\nChromong, more people started to appear. I must have gotten a really early start,\nor was just way ahead of the others.\n\nThe descent wasn't so bad, a bit slow going given that I was starting to get\nlow on energy, and my knees could use the break. I took a brief rest at the\nbottom before having to walk up the hundreds/thousands of stairs going up to\nthe upper area of Chomrong.\n\nAs I went up there were some horses blocking the path that I went around, and\nthen later on some scary looking bulls with big horns that didn't seem to give a\nsecond thought to me being on the trail, and kept marching down at full speed.\nI had a flashback to my scary cow encounter in Switzerland, and quickly jumped\nup on top of some large boulders as the bulls came walking through where I had\nbeen standing a moment ago.\n\nFreshly full of andrenaline I continued up the stairs towards the places to stay.\nThe place I had in mind didn't have any rooms available as it was now early\nafternoon, and so I continued on seeing what places looked welcoming. I found\none a little higher up the stairs which wasn't fun to keep going up, but\nnevertheless I made it and got a room to myself on the second floor with a view\nof the valley below.\n\nTurns out some of the people I had met at the dining hall in Basecamp yesterday\nwere staying here as well, and I also befriended a father-daughter pair from\nEngland. We all ate dinner together (this place had pizza, but it sadly wasn't\nas good as the other place.), and talked about life in our different countries.\nThe people from England had a non-London accent and it was really hard to\nunderstand them.\n\nTonight would be my last night on trail, and I was sad to be leaving the\nmountains behind and having to go back to Pokhara and the bustle of a crowded\ncity.\n\n";
