We all\nslept pretty well last night, and no one snored! No rush to get going today, so\nwe took our time leaving.\n\nWe passed by some pretty tall waterfalls on our way out of the village, and it\nfelt good to get misted on by the falling waters. We walked along the river\ncreated by the waterfall for a while, even as we got higher and higher up. More\nsuspension bridges greeted us as we had to cross back-n-forth over the river\nduring the course of today's trail.\n\n<Gallery images={['2019/10/19/ea3305ca-de4d-408b-a052-3dff987c2c2d.jpeg']} title=\"A waterfall on our way out of the village\" />\n\nThe trail was a mixture of gravel, dirt, grass, and mud today. Luckily it was\nmostly footpaths, and only a small section was shared with the occasional\npassing jeep.\n\nA few hours in and we stopped for lunch at a teahouse perched on the edge of a\ncliff. They had beds here, but it didn't look very inviting. The food though,\ncan't go wrong with veggie mo-mo and orange soda. The place had a great\nview of the valley below though, and of all the tiered fields and homes hugging\nthe side of the mountains. We stayed here for more than hour relaxing.\n\nAs we left the lunch spot we entered the area of Gandaki, and were greeted by\na large archway over the trail welcoming us. We were getting high enough now\nthat we can look out over the valley, and trail we had covered so far, below us.\n\n<Gallery images={['2019/10/19/1974b5b8-a49d-487c-894d-6f4934bfbb25.jpeg']} title=\"Welcome to the Gandaki region\" />\n\nA beautiful waterfall broke up the trail a little further in, and we had a fun\ntime waiting for the hikers in front of us to find their way across the\nslippery stones. A few trekking poles and hats were lost to the fast flowing\nwaters.\n\nOn and on we marched over rock and dirt trails carved into the mountainside,\neach blind bend in the trail revealing amazing views as we made our way around.\nBefore too long and we were at our place for the night: Jagat. A fun attraction\nfor this place is a steam bath fed by natural hotsprings. It was a bit of a side\nhike to go down to it at the rivers edge, and the hike back up wasn't fun (\nthankfully we weren't that high up in elevation yet or else it would have been\na lot harder). Lots of the locals also used the waters to bath it seems.\n\n<Gallery images={['2019/10/19/b42f1cf9-d596-48ec-9a93-d72541f939d9.jpeg']} title=\"Jagat\" />\n\nThere was a suspension bridge that connected one side of the gorge to the other\nup near the village, and our group posed for a photo on the bridge. It was\nswaying so much with the slightest movement, we all hurried off of the bridge\nonce the photo was taken. Why push our luck?\n\n";
