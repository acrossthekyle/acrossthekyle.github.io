I awoke from a very restful night\nof sleep, and headed downstairs to an empty dining hall. Nearly all of the\nguests had left in the early morning hours to do a sunrise trek to the top of\nthe nearby Poon Hill.\n\nAs I sat in the dining room alone, waiting for breakfast, one of the hikers from\nlast night came down. I thanked them again for what they did, knowing I could\nnever repay these strangers kindness.\n\nI ordered as much warm food as I could for breakfast.\n\nWith a full belly, and renewed lease on life, I set out for Chomrong, and the\nstart of the Annapurna Basecamp trek. It was a fog-filled morning as I left\nthe village behind. The trail today would also be a bit empty as many people\ndon't take this particular way to get to Chomrong.\n\nI must have walked through fog-covered hills for a good three hours before\nleaving it behind and entering a forest with leaves of all different colors. It\nfelt like Fall back home. Turns out it was a forest preserve, and there were lots\nof families hiking through it.\n\nA little while later I came to a small set of teahouses and took a lunch break\nhere. No repeating the mistakes from yesterday; eat when food is available I've\nlearned. I had a big plate of pasta (nothing special) and a couple of colas\nbefore heading off into the jungle once more. After a short while I heard\nsome noises in the trees, and looked up to see monkeys swinging from the\nbranches! It was an awesome sight, but for some reason I was nervous about them\nbeing aggressive and I quickened my pace.\n\nAfter leaving the jungle the trail went down the side of a steep valley, and then\nback up the other side. A couple of hours later and I arrived in Chomrong. I\nmust have gained more elevation (in total) today than I did yesterday, but\nfor some reason today didn't feel as hard.\n\nI found a great place to stay that had awesome views of the valley and hills,\nand had some of the best food, including pizza, on this trip so far.\n\n";
