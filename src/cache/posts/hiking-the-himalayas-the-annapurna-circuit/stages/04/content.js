Another\nsuspension bridge took us out of town and into thick forests made up of a\nmix of conifer and deciduous trees. An arch over the trail thanked us for\nvisiting.\n\nThe trail was also becoming more congested with hikers, seeing as some choose\nto take a jeep past the first few places and skip ahead. We feel like we're\ntrue hikers who are doing the whole thing from beginning to end.\n\nAt the next village we came across prayer drums that spin in a row and you're\nmeant to spin them clockwise in order to get good luck for trekking in the\nmountains. We're going to make sure we do this every chance we get!\n\n<Gallery images={['2019/10/19/4cf2bda2-3283-4318-937b-9937f3c23c08.jpeg']} title=\"Snow-capped peaks in the distance\" />\n\nAnother big waterfall crossing today, luckily only one hat was lost in this one.\nMost of the day after that was spent walking through woods with leaves of\nvarious colors, with long suspension bridge crossings scattered here and there.\n\nIn the distance we could start to see snow-capped peaks. Six hours later and we\ncame to Chame.\n\n";
