Small\nscraggly bushes now dominated the landscape around us as we retraced our steps.\nAt an outlook point overlooking Manang we stopped and posed for pictures, saying\ngoodbye to the first half of this circuit, and then turned to the left and\ncontinued our hike upwards and onto another valley.\n\nUpon entering this new valley we could see the entire trail laid out before us,\ntwisting and bending and winding its way over the terrain. On we marched, heads\ndown, focused on closing the distance between us and our place for the night at\nThoron Phedi. We stopped for lunch at a place that had teepees available for\nsleeping in, and enjoyed some food and sodas.\n\nIt was still going to take us another 3-4 hours before we would be able to see\nthe refuge for the night. Up and down the rocks we went, over rivers, through\nsmall thinly wooded forests, climbing ever higher. Today we would technically\nbe losing more elevation than we would be gaining, but it was still a challenge\nto gain any altitude.\n\nAt long last we arrived, nearly 7 hours after starting the days hike. These were\nsome of the hardest mattresses I have ever slept on, but this place had\n__*the best*__ veggie burger that I have ever had. Tomorrow wouldn't\nbe as early of a day as yesterday was, so we had a chance to catch up on some\nsleep before making the pass.\n\n";
