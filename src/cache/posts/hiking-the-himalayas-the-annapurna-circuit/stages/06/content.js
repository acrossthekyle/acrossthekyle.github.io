Given that we're up near an\naltitude of about 9,000 feet, this was no easy feat. It took nearly an hour\nto seemingly not go far far horizontally, but a lot of distance vertically.\nPisang looked so tiny now from up here.\n\nThe trail from here hugged the side of a sandy-colored mountain, dotted with\nold temples and homes built out of large flat stones, and covered with banners\nthat had tiny little flags attached to them in all sorts of colors. We're told\nthey're prayer flags.\n\nAt the next small sparsely populated village we took a break. The whole world\naround us is colored like sand, with white snowcapped mountain peaks surrounding\nit. It's hard to tell how many of these buildings in this small villages are\nstill lived in, and how many are just ruins. We also pass by a bunch of small\ntemples dedicated to Buddha.\n\nThe trail is long today, but at long last we came back to the river that has\nbeen our constant companion since the beginning, and follow it along a dusty\nroad past herds of yaks grazing along its sides. Lots of jeeps coming through\nhere today, which meant hurrying off of the road and covering our faces to\navoid the dust storms they kick up. I wish I had my neck buff for this.\n\nWe finally reached Manang at 11,500 feet just a few hours before nightfall. It\ntook a bit of searching, but we finally found a place to stay that \"felt right\"\nto everyone in our group, and booked rooms for two nights here since we would be\ndoing a day-hike tomorrow up to a lake at 15,000 feet as part of a conditioning\nroutine that would get us ready for the highest point of the trek in a few days.\n\nIn the morning we grabbed our jackets, and water bottles, and set out going back\nthe way we had come the previous day in order to make it to the beginning of the\nlake trail. The way up was hard, and took nearly 5 hours to get up there. But\nonce we got up there the views were jaw-dropping. It was the highest I had\never been in my life. It was soo cold up there that we weren't able to stay\nlong before our fingers inside of our gloves started to freeze. The way down\nwasn't as bad, but half of our group got separated and we ended up getting lost\non the way down. Luckily we found our way back to the road, and to our home\nfor the night.\n\nLater that evening we went a movie theatre that was really just a small room\nbehind a local bar and watched the movie \"Everest\". We had hoped it would be\n\"Seven Years in Tibet\" but this was just as good. What an eerie thing to watch\nthough as we're about to go much higher in elevation over the next few days.\n\n";
