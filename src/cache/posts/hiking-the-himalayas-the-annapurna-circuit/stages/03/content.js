We're always gaining elevation\nevery single day, but there's still plenty of long stretches where we're\nwalking on flat terrain for a while.\n\nWe made our way out of Jagat and started gaining lots of elevation. Today would\nbe mostly spent walking along the side of a deep valley. Plenty of little\nwaterfalls dotted the trail today.\n\nAfter about four hours of going up and up and up, the trail too us along the\nriver bed of the river that we had been hiking alongside for the past two days.\nHere we walked along stony beaches towards a village perched along the waters\nedge. This is where we had the best mo-mo so far of the trip, and we've been\nsure to have mo-mo everywhere we go since half of us were vegetarians. And it\nwas so darn good!\n\n<Gallery images={['2019/10/19/c2acaecb-9824-473f-ad37-d678093cfc44.jpeg','2019/10/19/63d22102-eb79-43cd-9aec-7840b359421a.jpeg']} title=\"Heading up into the mountains, and lunch on the river\" />\n\nOnce we left our long restful lunch, where one of the kids who lived there spent\nmost of the time chancing their pet rabbit around, it was time to start getting\nback into the mountains once more. About two hours later and we arrived in\nDharapani. We struggled to find an affordable place to stay, but eventually\nfound one. The power also went in-and-out tonight at this village (apparently\nthis is common in the mountains of Nepal).\n\nI can't remember much of today, partly because I didn't take many\nphotos nor a journal.\n\n";
