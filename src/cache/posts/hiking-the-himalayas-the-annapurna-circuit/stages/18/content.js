I set off early in the morning just after\nbreakfast and began the mostly downward trail towards a jeep station where\nI would hitch a ride back to Pokhara. I did however enjoy a nice sunrise on my\nlittle private balcony.\n\nNot many people were on this part of the trail today as I passed through\nseveral small groupings of teahouses and through bright green scenery. There were\na few areas where I had to walk on a road, but luckily no vehicles came through.\nLots of lovely trees in this area though.\n\nI was making good time, now eager to get back to my stuff at the Hostel, and a\nhot shower. I had decided, last night, to book a different hostel that looked\nmuch nicer and that offered excursions such as paragliding.\n\nThe jeep station was a simple place that offered cold drinks and a shaded area\nwith benches to wait at while a car arrived. I didn't have to wait long though.\nThe journey back to Pokhara was split up into two parts: the first was the\njeep ride down the rough mountain dirt road (the car was bouncing all over\nthe place). We had to wait for a little bit at one point as crews worked to clear\na fresh landslide. The second part of the journey came after the jeep went about\nhalfway down the mountain, and was on paved roads. Here they pulled into a\nparking lot and I was transferred to a pre-paid taxi that took me the rest of\nthe way down to Pokhara.\n\nMy adventure in the Himalayas was done. This was an amazing experience. I met\nsome amazing friends that I keep in touch with, and had saw some amazing things.\nThe world and culture of the Himalayas is very pleasant and relaxing. I wish\nI could keep doing this forever. And not to mention the near-death experience a\nfew nights ago. This will go down as one of my favorite experiences and places,\nand maybe someday I'll work up the courage to come back and attempt the Everest\nBasecamp trek that is also very popular.\n\n";
