Groggy,\nand hungry, I gathered any loose things of mine, grabbed my backpack, and\npacked everything up outside where I wouldn't disturb anyone.\n\nThe previous day I had taken a taxi from the airport to the hostel I stayed at,\nbut it was too early in the morning today for a ride, so that meant walking to\nthe bus station. The walk wasn't that bad, maybe 10 minutes? I felt like a fool\nfor taking a taxi yesterday. The bus station itself was little more than a dirt\nparking lot behind some buildings. There was a food stand selling coffee and\npastries, and boy was I starving. I bought a couple of pastries, and a banana.\n\nOther hikers were alredy there at the bus station, and more continued to arrive\nas I waited. There were people of all ages doing this hike, or various others\nin the area. The bus driver announced which bus was for Besishar, and I walked\nover to it and waited. While I waited some folks joined me, and we introduced\nourselves: Katie from New Zealand, Nathan from England, and VÃ©ronique from\nCanada. We hit it off right away, and this would be our group, more or less, for\nthe entire circuit.\n\n<Gallery images={['2019/10/19/51d4bc23-b300-4b68-a773-5d83e2b283c7.jpeg']} title=\"The jungles of Nepal on the first day\" />\n\nThe bus ride to Besishar (the starting point of the circuit/thru-hike) was a\nlong and bumpy one. It picked up several locals as well on the way there, some\neven brought furniture on the bus with them. Space got tight for a little while.\nIt was late morning by the time we arrived. Nathan, at the behest of the rest\nof us, had to purchase a down jacket and some other gear that he had not\noriginally brought with him. Luckily theres were \"cheap\" here in Nepal.\n\nFinally we set off on the trail and began the circuit. The trail went up from\nthe city and into the jungles, and crossed a very long and narrow suspension\nbridge over a gorge with a fast-flowing river below. As we got further along\nand into the jungle bright green fields of crops started to pop up all around us.\nThe homes where the farmers lived were all vibrantly colored in reds, pinks,\ngreens, and yellows, and most of them had bright blue roofs.\n\nAs we hiked we got lost in conversation, and ended up getting lost about\nhalfway in. Time to bust out the Maps app. We thought we found the trail\non the app, but after a short while of walking we realized it wasn't the right\nway. A small family of farmers were working in their field and we went up to\nthem to see if they could help us. The parents knew English very well, and were\nable to point out the way. They were also excited to show their kids our\nsmartphones.\n\n<Gallery images={['2019/10/19/741e7c4c-823d-419b-bb74-b9ac667fcc13.jpeg']} title=\"One of many rickety suspension bridges\" />\n\nNow that we were back on track we started walking at a slightly brisker pace. I\nwas starting to get really hungry at this point, seeing as I had only had a\ncouple of pastries and a banana for breakfast some 6 hours ago, but I kept\ngoing. We stopped for some water at a small waterfall, but the water filter\npouch I had sprung a leak, and therefore I wasn't able to use the water filter\nsystem anymore. Thankfully Katie had a ton of extra chlorine tablets and I ended\nup using those for the rest of the trip.\n\nWe walked for about another hour, crossing more suspension bridges (the last of\nwhich looked like it would fall apart at any moment), and finally made it to the\noutskirts of Bhulbule, the village we would be spending the night in. But as we\nentered the village, my body decided that it had had enough and I instantly felt\nsuper weak and tired. I busted out some protein bars that I had brought with me\nfor this first day of hiking, and we took a break on some stone steps leading\ninto the village.\n\n<Gallery images={['2019/10/19/7249e9e9-47d0-4fde-8cda-c579801f7a4b.jpeg']} title=\"Entry into the village\" />\n\nRested, and fed, it was time to begin the task of finding a place to sleep.\nThe Annapurna Circuit relies on a system of teahouses for housing the hikers who\nattempt the hike, and these teahouses are run by local families. We found one\nthat had a nice eating area, showers, and clean-looking rooms, and we began\nthe negotiating process. In the end the owner gave us a room for three, with a\nfourth mattress that they put on the floor, so that we could get a discounted\nrate for staying there, and since we agreed to have dinner at their place we\nwere locked in.\n\nWhat a series of events today: making three new friends right out of the gate,\na long and bumpy bus ride, getting lost in the jungle, and nearly collapsing\nfrom hunger. The place we were staying at had nice hot showers though, and\ngreat food! Here's to a less eventful day tomorrow.\n\n";
