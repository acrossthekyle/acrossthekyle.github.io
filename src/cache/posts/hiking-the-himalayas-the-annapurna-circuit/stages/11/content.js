Katie from New Zealand\nwould be saying goodbye and taking a bus from the town just before Marpha and\nheading back to Pokhara in order to continue their backpacking adventures around\nthe world. Veronique hung back in order to call her boyfriend back home, so Katie\nand I said goodbye and then hit the trail.\n\nTodays trail would take us up and over light-brown mountains and hills, and\nalong dried river beds that at some point in the year must hold massive flowing\nrivers. It was nice to have an alternative to walking on the road though. We\nalso crossed over several suspension bridges as we descended out of the mountains.\n\nIt felt like a long day of ups and downs, with not much variation in the landscape\naround us. This part of the trail was also much much emptier as people usually\ntake a jeep from Muktinath instead of walking the rest of the circuit, and it\nshows. There were decidedly fewer places to stay on this second half.\n\nA few hours later and we were in the town just before Marpha. Katie and I\ngrabbed some lunch together before saying goodbye. As we ate we saw Veronique\nwalking by. After saying goodbye to Katie I did my best to try and catch up to\nVeronique. I was nervous about being alone again on the trail after 11 days of\nwalking with the same group of people.\n\nIn the town of Marpha I found a place to stay by myself. It wasn't the best\nplace, and there was no one else there. I got settled in and went out to walk the\nlittle village. There wasn't much to see, but as luck would have it I ran into\nVeronique and she said she had found a great place to stay. We went back and\npacked up my stuff and set off for this other place. It had a friendly host,\nand comfy beds, but I was most excited for not having to hike along tomorrow.\n\n";
