Green bushes and grasses gave way to mostly\nbare rock faces covered in thing yellow grasses as I headed deeper and higher\ninto the valley between the mountainsides.\n\nI felt like a tiny nothing while hiking through these massive rock formations.\nAfter an hour or so the first patches of snow started to appear. The world\naround me had been jungle not 60 minutes earlier, and now here I was suddenly\ntransported to a new world.\n\nThere was a refuge on the way to Basecamp, but I wanted to be surrounded by\nsnow, and kept going. A helicopter kept droning overhead as it went up and down\nthe valley. My guess was resupply, but I later found out it was bringing\ntourists up to Basecamp, allowing them to bypass the hike altogether.\n\nClouds started to build as I continued on, now walking through inches of snow\nand over icy surfaces. Fresh snow must have fallen last night, because the trail\nwas hard to find, and I ended up doing a little bit of bushwacking as I made my\nway. Up ahead though I could see the Basecamp refuge as clouds started to fill\nthe world around me. More snow was coming, but I had made it just in time.\n\nIt didn't take long to get to Basecamp from Deurali, maybe 3 hours max? I could\nhave probably made it yesterday, if it weren't for the rain which was most\nlikely snow up at these elevations. My cash was running out, and I ended up\nhaving to sharing a room with a French couple I had met down in Chomrong. After\ngetting settled in and taking a nice hot shower, I went to the good-sized\ndining hall to hang out, eat, read, and enjoy this winter wonderland around me.\n\nThe snow storm lasted for a few hours, and after it passed the skies were a\ncrystal-clear blue with some remaining clouds scooting along the surface in a\nweird fog/cloud-inversion mix. I took this opportunity to walk around a bit and\ncheckout a dropoff nearby that had some great cloud-inversion going on.\n\nI made a lot of progress on my book today, seeing as how I had arrived by late\nmorning. A couple of dogs that lived around the refuges (not sure if they had\nowners) kept trying to sneak into the dining hall to get out of the cold and\nto beg for food, but the hosts kept shooing them out.\n\nDuring lunch and dinner I made some friends with a couple of Americans from\nColorado and Washington. They seemed like decent people. After the sun set\nthere wasn't much more reading I could do in the dim lights of the dining hall.\nDidn't matter though, I wanted to go to bed early in order to wake up to see\nthe sunrise.\n\n";
