It was cold\nand hard to move so early in the morning, but we managed to make our way onto\nthe trail with our headlamps lighting the way.\n\nSunrise came about an hour and a half into our hike, slowly revealing the\nsnowy-white world around us. The first half of the trail wasn't too bad,\nbut the second half, as we got higher and higher, forced us to stop and take\nmore breaks. Once we got to the more flat part of the trail our speed increased\nand we made it to the lake about 2-3 hours after starting.\n\nWhile the lake itself wasn't unique in any obvious way, other than being at\nsuch a high elevation, it was the snow-covered mountains around us that really\nset the mood. As we stood there staring out of the lake a rumbling sound in the\ndistance caught our attention and up near one of the peaks we could see an\navalanche starting to careen down towards the lake. It was on the far side, so\nwe were in no immediate danger, but it was an amazing sight to see.\n\nWe couldn't stay long at the lake for it was far too cold and our fingers were\ngoing numb inside of our gloves (I even had to layers of gloves on). As we\nwere leaving another, much larger, avalanche occurred that filled the space above\nthe lake with powdery snow, but we were too far below the ridgeline to see it\nfully sadly.\n\nThe way down went much faster, as it always dows, and we were moving at a fast\npace in order to warm back up. We debated stopping at Basecamp on our way back\nfor breakfast but decided to keep moving and stay at Shree Kharka instead because\nthere was one particular place that had a dining hall with an amazing view of\nthe mountains and valley below us.\n\nThe way back over the landslide-ridden trail went by much easier than it did\nyesterday, and again luckily there were no incidents. We chilled for the rest of\nthe day at Shree Kharka, playing card games, listening to podcasts, and eating.\nWe made our plans to go to Thorong Phedi tomorrow, and then onto Thorong La Pass\n(the highest point on the trek at 18,500 feet) and then to Muktinath.\n\n";
