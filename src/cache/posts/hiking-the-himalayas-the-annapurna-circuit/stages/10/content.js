Today would be another day of less altitude\ngain when compared to how much we would lose. We ate our breakfast in a hurry\nas we were eager to begin.\n\nIt was a slow march up from Thorong Phedi to the pass. The trail was crowded,\nand thanks to the extreme elevations we were at (we started at 15,000 feet) we\nhad to stop and take many breaks. One foot in front of the other, that's all\nya gotta do. But after 3.5 hours we made it to the pass!\n\nWe were filled with joy at accomplishing such a tremendous effort. We dropped\nour heavy packs and reveled in what we had done. Our group of three crouched and\nposed for a photo at the sign marking the high point of the circuit. As we stood\nup we all became extremely light-headed and dizzy. It was no joke moving around\nat these altitudes. Even the slightest amount of steps caused us to become\nwinded. Eventually though it was time to start our long descent down towards\nMuktinath.\n\nAfter three hours of racing down the mountain, and stopping for a refreshment\nbreak at a refuge on the way down, we made it to Muktinath. This was a fairly\ngood-sized city with plenty of places to stay and stores to window-shop at.\nWe chose a place called Bob Marleys and it was a pretty nice place. They had\nnice showers with rain showerheads, comfy beds, and one of the best restaurants\non the trek. Seriously, I had some pasta Carbonara here (my first time having\nit) and it was amazing! They also had a nice lounge below the restaurant for\nhanging out.\n\n";
