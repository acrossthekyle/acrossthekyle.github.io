We knew to expect the unexpected, but we weren't prepared\nfor how amazing the historical landmarks were, or how different the culture was.\n\nWe arrived in Cairo at night, close to midnight. The process for gaining\nentrance to Egypt was a confusing and stressful one. First we had to wait in\nline at a bank (the sole nearby ATM was out of cash), and then head over to\nanother line at another counter in order to get a Visa, and then finally wait\nin line at customs for getting our passports stamped. Once all of that was done\nwe then had to face the crowds of taxis drivers standing at the entrance trying\nto get a ride from us. Luckily the low-budget hotel in Giza that we booked had\narranged for someone to pick us up.\n\nRight out of the gate (no pun intended) we were told by the driver that seat\nbelts are not required in Egypt, and sure enough there were none in the backseat.\nOnly the driver had one. He also said that there are \"no rules\" in Egypt. We\nexchanged nervous glances but didn't know what else to do in terms of a ride\nso we didn't voice any concerns. The driver gave us a verbal tour of the\ndifferent parts of Cairo and pointed out the \"old city\" and \"new city\". It was\nobvious which was old and which was new. It also appears that lane markings on\nthe road are also not required to be followed, with cars driving all over the\nplace.\n\nWe arrived at the hotel in Giza, which was really just a single floor at the\ntop of a building, and entered through a muddy back alley. The room we had\nbooked with a pyramid view wasn't available, so they stuck us in a windowless\nroom. Things were not looking good so far.\n\n## The Great Pyramids of Giza\n\n<Gallery images={['2023/12/28/153d516a-0479-4451-a89a-d23dc91592ec.jpeg']} title=\"\" />\n\nThe next morning we ate breakfast on the rooftop terrace, which did\nhave views of the pyramids, and they looked amazing. They still seemed so far\naway but here we were staring at them in person. Afterwards we walked to the\nGiza plateau since it was within less than a mile of where we were staying. The\nroute to get there was sketchy: we walked under highways, through construction\nzones, and along local streets. The entrance to the plateau was hectic, with\nlots of line-cutting (must be the norm in Egypt), but finally we emerged.\n\nAnd there they were, the most infamous ancient wonders in the world: the Great\nPyramids of Giza. Pictures don't do it justice, these things were huge! Not only\nthat, but we were able to walk through the ruins of other structures around\nthe pyramids as well.\n\nI love being able to walk up to, and touch, history. We were able to freely\nexplore the entire area, and see all of the pyramids of close and personal, from\nall angles. We walked up to and around all three large pyramids, and then went\nto the Sphinx. What an amazing experience this all is! Definitely a huge wow\nfactor. But the best part was coming up: going into the Great Pyramid itself.\n\nThe entrance into the Great Pyramid was from grave robbers who had tunneled in long,\nlong ago. Once we got through their tunnels, we finally entered the corridors\nbuilt by the ancient Egyptians. These corridors were very tight and cramped. I\ncan't imagine what it must have been like for the ancient workers who had to go\nup and down these all day long. The Kings Chamber was our destination, and it\nwas just like the pictures from our history books: plain and empty. But that\ndoesn't matter, because we're standing inside of the great pyramid!\n\nBut now it was time to leave. We had seen it all, and now needed to make a\ndecision on where we were staying tonight.\n\n## The Marriott\n\nThe hotel in Giza was a distaster, and we didn't feel safe staying there\nanother night. Nor did we need to. The only reason we had booked it was to have\na view of the pyramids at night while we explored Cairo during the day. But\ngiven how far of a drive it was from Cairo to Giza, and the fact that our room\nwasn't the one we had reserved, we decided to book a room in a Marriott in\ndowntown Cairo: it was a 5 star hotel in what used to be a royal palace.\n\nWe had a hard to time getting a refund from the Giza hotel owners, but eventually\nthey gave us a 75% refund (considering we had already stayed one night) in cash.\nI felt nervous carrying so much money on me. Our Uber ride from Giza to the\nnew hotel was charotic: the driver got lost a couple of times, but we finally\nmade it.\n\nThis place was a dream! We should have booked this the first time around. It\nwas on an island, so it already felt nicer and safer, plus the surrounding\nbuildings and area were very upscale, or at least upscale compared to where we\njust were. It had a guarded private entrance, and felt like a true and proper\nhotel on the inside.\n\nWe got an executive room that came with private access to a lounge where food\nand drinks were practically unlimited. We had most of our meals and daytime\nsnacks up there, along with all the wine we could handle. There was a brunch\narea on the first floor, as well as an outdoor hookah area. It was amazing, and\nworth the inflated New Years Eve price! Plus our room had a great view of Cairo\nTower where we were told the fireworks for NYE would be going off.\n\n## Saqqarra and Memphis\n\n<Gallery images={['2023/12/28/95e941e4-77ff-4fb5-b600-54e31e9b0684.jpeg']} title=\"\" />\n\nThe next day we booked a guided tour to Saqqarra where we visited the Bent, and\nStepped, pyramids up close. It was so cool to see the evolution of the pyramids,\nand in the distance we could see the ruins of a handful of other pyramids that\njust didn't work. Our guide also provided us with a good amount of background\nknowledge about the history of these pyramids, and of ancient Egypt. We wish\nwe had this kind of experience at the Great Pyramids yesterday.\n\nAt the Stepped pyramid complex our guide got us free access to a tour of the\ntombs and we saw our first heiroglyphics in person. It was a short tour, but\nit was amazing nonetheless.\n\nWhile our guide was informative about lots of things, we feel like we missed out\non seeing more, like going underneath the Stepped pyramid and exploring the\ntunnels within. They said it wasn't that great so it was better to skip it. We\nlater assumed they were just doing the bare minimum in order to get their pay\nday.\n\nAfterwards our guide sort of kind of forced us to to a papyrus-making gift shop,\nand the later to a perfume gift shop. We felt watched the entire time we were\nthere by the employees, who were practically begging for a sale. But it was neat\nto see how papryus was made using the ancient technique.\n\nWe returned to our palace on the island and relaxed in the lounge and lower\nhookah areas for the rest of the day.\n\n## The Renowned Bazaar of Cairo, and The National Museum of Egyptian Civilization\n\nThe National Museum of Egyptian Civilization was huge when compared to the\nprevious one. It was also much more modern, with plenty of well-thought-out\nspace for everything. The exhibits were also arranged in chronological order\nso that you could take a journey through Egyptian history from the time before\nthe Pharoahs and pyramids, to the modern age.\n\nIn the lower levels they had a nice dark area with a bunch of mummies from\nvarious points of history of ancient Egypt. It was also very well maintained,\nand respectful. They asked for silence on the way in, and everyone in there\nactually respected the rules for a change.\n\nAfter the museum we decided to take an Uber to an infamos Bazaar in Cairo, one\nthat had been in continuous operation for hundreds of years. The taxi/Uber ride\nto the bazaar was hectic. The driver, for some reason, decided to drive through\nthe streets of the bazaar itself. We got so many angry looks from the locals.\n\nThe market itself was very crowded, and kind of confusing. We got lost a couple\nof times, and were worried we wouldn't be able to make it out to the way we\nhad come in. There was also a lof of creepy looks from the shop owners, and no\none let us walk by in peace.\n\nNeedless to say, this was a bad experience, and not something I would recommend.\n\n## The Egyptian Museum\n\nEgypt was currently in the process of building a brand new museum on the Giza\nplateau, but it wasn't ready yet when we where there, so we went to the \"old\"\nmuseum of Egypt called The Egyptian Museum. They had said lots of things would be missing because they were\nbeing moved to the new museum, but there was still tons to see. It was obvious\nthough that they needed a new and much larger museum becaue the current one\nwas stuffed to the brim with artifacts.\n\nThere were tons of coffins, statues both big and small, and funerary things to\nsee. But the coolest part was seeing Tuts coffin and burial mask. It was huge,\nand so bright with all of that gold. Such an amazing sight.\n\nWe toured the rest of the museum for close to 2 hours before deciding we had had\nenough and wanted to retire to our hotel and relax for the rest of the day,\nenjoying that private lounge bonus. On the way out we each got souveniors from\nthe museum gift shop.\n\n## Fireworks and NYE\n\nLater that night was New Years Eve, and we had a very large meal at a restaurant\non the main level, and bought a series of small cakes to take back up to the\nroom with us. We set up camp on our balcony in order to watch the fireworks, and\nas I said before we had a great view. They even lit up the tower with the\ncountdown. What a magical experience to be able to experience NYE in a foriegn\nland.\n\n## Luxor, Luxor Temple, and Karnak\n\n<Gallery images={['2023/12/28/64f048a8-dd6b-4abb-90e4-46fc8237f623.jpeg','2023/12/28/5c4e717f-e226-44c7-b136-d058a1e96e9b.jpeg']} title=\"\" />\n\nOn January 2nd we checked out of our luxury hotel and flew to Luxor. It was a\nshort flight, but it was better than taking the train or the bus. The city is a\nmuch less crowded place than Cairo, and less hectic, but still the same behavior\nfrom shop owners and locals, begging for money or harassing us to see if we\nwanted to go on a camel ride.\n\nThe place we booked here was supposedly a 4 star hotel, but really it was a\n3 star hotel. It was alongside the riverwalk near the Luxor Temple, and within\nwalking distanceo of Karnak, so it suited us well. But the bed was terribly\nuncomfortable, and there was smoking everywhere inside the hotel. The only\nrestaurant in the joint had a terrible selection for dinner. But there was a\nbuffet-style breakfast and lunch on the second floor, and those weren't that bad!\n\nThe next day we checked out Luxor Temple, which was really cool to be standing\nat the base of these humungous columns and satues. We spotted Greek writing\nmixed in with ancient Egyptian which checks out with what the guide from the\nother day told us about Alexandar the Greats conquering of Egypt and introduction\nof the helenistic culture(s).\n\nWe then walked down the lonely Avenue of Sphinxes towards the Karnak temple\ncomplex. No one else was on the avenue, so we had it all to ourselves, and we\nmuch preferred walking along that then walking along the busy streets.\n\nLuxor was amazing, but Karnak was huge! This temple complex was amazing. It was\nbig, tall, and the paintings on the walls were still in great condition. There\nwere so many things to see here. We spent a long time around around and checking\neverything out.\n\nAfter a long walk back to the hotel we decided to book a guided tour for the next\nday to the Valley of the Kings, and Queens. We didn't dare try to go it alone\ngive how hectic the pyramids were.\n\n## Valley of the Kings, Queens, and Habu Temple\n\n<Gallery images={['2023/12/28/db9e500f-328c-4dca-b564-dfa15770748a.jpeg','2023/12/28/a0c09440-0ea8-4eda-83bd-121b3d31d61a.jpeg']} title=\"\" />\n\nThis guide was a little better than our previous one, but still weird: he\nadmitted to marrying his cousins. Yes, plural. We stopped by the Colossi of\nMemnon on the way to the valleys, and snapped some selfies. Cool to see, but\nnot overly wowing.\n\nThe Valley of the Kings was really cool, so many tombs to see. The guide got\nus in, and helped pay for things by cutting the line, and then let us go do\nour own thing once inside. We saw lots of cool tombs, including the tomb of\nking Tut himself. These tomb chambers were so complex, and artfully decorated.\n\nQueens Valley was less crowded so we got more time to walk around and see what\nwe wanted. There was only one tomb where you had to pay to enter, and we skipped it,\nbut the rest were still equally as amazing.\n\nHabu Temple, the last one, takes the cake though. It was the most amazing\ntemple that I had seen on this trip, and it was in amazing condition. The\nartworks and paintings were still pristine, and our guide got us amazing\nbehind-the-scenes access, and told us a ton of not-so-commonly known facts about\nthe place, and its historical purpose.\n\n## A sunrise balloon ride over Luxor\n\n<Gallery images={['2023/12/28/3b64df45-ea62-4f49-bce6-ca8f0a4349e4.jpeg']} title=\"\" />\n\nThis was the highlight of our time in Egypt, and Luxor. On January 4th we were\npicked up from our hotel at 4am, along with a bunch of others, and shuttled to\na balloon ride launching area. We waited in the cold dark early hours of the\nmorning for our time to fly.\n\nThe all-clear signl was given to the balloon ride companies, and their teams of\nworkers ran out to the balloons eager to be the first in the air. It was an\namazing sight watching these huge things go from the flames burning within them.\n\nOur time came and we were shuffled into the basket of our balloon with the most\ncharistmatic captian one could hope for on an outing such as this. He gave us a\nrundown of do's and dont's, and then we were off and ascending into the air.\n\nThe captian had a little jingle he kept singing: \"Everything I do, I do for you.\"\nIt made us smile and laugh, and kept things cheery. The ride over the Valley of\nthe Kings and Queens below us was amazing. The sunrise, the views, it was the\nperfect ending to this vacation.\n\n## Returning to Cairo and leaving Egypt behind\n\nIt was time to return to Cairo for our flight home the next day. We stayed at a\ndifferent 5 star hotel, but this one wasn't as nice as the Marriott. But the\nroom did have great sunset views from the balcony.\n\nWe left at around 6:00 am the next day to begin our journey home, and we were\nglad to leave.\n\nEgypt is an amazing place if you only consider the historical things. The\nway the locals treat foriegners leaves something to be desired. If we ever\ncame back we would definitely do it through a service that would plan\neverything for us, and rely on tour guides for everything.\n\nThis trip though was unique, and probably a once-in-a-lifetime experience, and\nwe enjoyed a lot of it.\n\n";
