We (read I) chose Mt. Shavano as our first peak\nto do together. It was another easy Class 2 trail, but it had a lot of elevation\ngain, somewhere in the area of 4,500 feet.\n\nWe camped at the trailhead in my small Duplex Zpacks backpacking tent. It is\ntechnically meant for two people, but our air mattresses were pushing the sides\nout and it was a cramped fit. It might be time to upgrade to a tent that is\nactually meant for two people. As a result though we didn't get much sleep, and\nwere eager to get and get going as soon as possible. By 5:00 am we were on the\ntrail.\n\nAfter a short, flat, part of the trail that shared some trail with the\nColorado Trail, we started to ascend over rocks and big tree roots. We passed by\nsome small water sources on the way up, and probably should have stopped and\nchugged some water and then refilled our water bottles, but we didn't.\n\n<Gallery images={['2021/09/07/a2979227-98b1-4f49-ae38-24f495ed07d5.jpeg']} title=\"Getting above the trees\" />\n\nAbout two and a half hours later and we were above the trees, and taking in the\nviews of the area. Since this was my partners first time being above 9,000 feet,\nwe took it slow, watching for signs of AMS. As a result we took lots of small\nbreaks, each of us huffing and puffing though given that this was the first one\nin over a year for me, and thanks to COVID-19 I wasn't able to go on a thru-hike\nover the summer. Two hours later and we're past the tree line, usually it\ndoesn't take this long.\n\nWe saw maybe three people on the entire trail all day, but that makes sense\nsince we were out here on a Tuesday, a week after a holiday weekend. There was\nlittle to no vegetation, not even weird looking plants, as we ascended up the\nmostly rocky mountain sides.\n\nAt this point we were starting to run low on water, given that the ascent so far\nhad taken longer than it normally does. We reached the col between two mountains\nand the summit trail after another hour. Time to begin the march to the summit.\n\n<Gallery images={['2021/09/07/d232b2cb-1d41-477c-a6ed-ac534e069b45.jpeg']} title=\"The col between mountains\" />\n\nAbout halfway up the summit we took a break. While we were snacking someone\nwas coming down from the summit and they told us that the view wasn't worth the\nrisk and trickyness of the summit, so after they left we decided to turn back\nearly, partly due to that warning but also the fact that we had mere drops of\nwater remaining in our bottles.\n\nOur spirits started to drop rapidly as we went down the trail. The lack of\nwater made it doubly rough thanks to the rising heat from the sun blasting\ndown on us. After struggling for nearly three hours, and having practically\nzero energy thanks to the heavy amounts of dehyrdation we were experiencing, we\nfinally made it down into the trees, and were maybe an hour from the car. Here\nwe came upon the smallest of water trickles coming out from between two rocks,\nand nearly sunk to our knees in joy. We busted out our water filters, and drank\nso much water.\n\n<Gallery images={['2021/09/07/8ad06daa-5c8c-4133-817c-d15c4e00d141.jpeg']} title=\"The summit\" />\n\nBodies rehydrated, we continued making our way to the car. The rest of the way\ndown wasn't too bad, and was only a little tricky when we got back to the rocks\nand roots section at the beginning.\n\nWe were happy to be alive and back at the car finally. This was the roughest and\nlongest 14'er to date. The lack of water resources on the trail really made it\ndoubly rough.\n\n";
