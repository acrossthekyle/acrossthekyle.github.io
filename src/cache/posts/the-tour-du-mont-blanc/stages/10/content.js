Unfortunately for those people the alternate route that went\naround the ladders was closed due to a landslide last week.\n\nThe sun’s rays of light were shooting out from behind the mountains as we left\nTré-le-Champ and disappeared into the woods once more. This was a mostly steady\ngain in elevation as we navigated tree roots, and various rocky outcroppings.\n\nOne of the more massive rocky obstacles was the Aiguillete d’Argentière monolith\nwhich had fallen down from the top of the mountain a long, long, time ago. It\nwas the size of a two-story house, and the path went right around its base.\n\nAfter rising several more meters above the monolith’s top we came to another\nrocky outcropping. This one had a perfect window between the trees facing back\ntowards the Mont Blanc range. We stood here for a few minutes watching the sun\ncome up behind the tallest point between the trees, and watching the rays of\nlight first point up, and then down as the sun rose higher.\n\nIt would take another hour of hiking through the gradually thinning trees before\ncoming to the first of the ladders. Along the way we spotted an Ibex in the\ndistance hoping from rock to rock.\n\nThe ladders themselves were simply just that: a series of metal ladder rungs and\nrods bolted into the rock in order to help hikers get up and over the terrain.\nThey weren’t the least bit scary, but I could understand that it might be a\ndifferent story if it had been cloudy. Of course everyone wanted photos of them\ngoing up them, so a line started to develop at some of them. Everyone’s butt is\nprobably in everyones pictures.\n\nWe took a break where the ladders ended, and the regular rocky path resumed. But\nthe lakes were calling, and we wanted to get there.\n\nThe first little puddle of a lake wasn’t that impressive, but the next one’s\nwaters were so still you could see Mont Blanc reflected in its surface. We took\nthe trail going around the back in order to take as many picture-perfect photos\nas possible.\n\nBut it’s not just the pictures; it’s also standing there in awe of the beauty\nbefore you.\n\nLac Blanc was another hour in front of us.\n\nThese were the most turquoise green waters that I have ever seen. As soon as we\nfound a spot to drop our gear, I disrobed down to my underwear and went for a\nswim. Oh my God was the water cold! It had that feeling of a thousand needles\npricking your skin at once. The only way to get over it is to dive in, and\nthat’s exactly what I did.\n\nI ended up going in twice, but only for a few moments each time. And, of course,\nI made someone take a picture from behind me as I looked out at Mont Blanc\nbecause yeah.\n\nSome folks made coffee while we laid out our cloths and towels to dry in the\nsunlight. After resting peacefully for 30 minutes we decided that it was time\nto get going.\n\nWe arrived at Refuge de lo Flegere a couple of hours later, and straight into\nthe middle of a spectacle.\n\nOn the other side of the valley there was a little bit of smoke rising up from a\nstructure of some sorts. Some of the people who worked for the ski lifts were\nwatching it with binoculars.\n\nI didn’t make anything of it and we went to check in. After getting situated and\nshowered I headed outside to sit in the sun. This is when I noticed that the\nlittle bit of smoke had turned into a full blown fire.\n\nAn emergency helicopter with a basket for water was making runs back and forth\nbetween the small water reservoir just below our Refuge and the fire. It was an\nimpressive site to see that thing cover the distance in a few seconds, drop its\nbasket down, fill it up with water, and not 10 seconds later be heading back to\ndrop it on the fire.\n\nIt took them a couple of hours, but they finally got it under control. I had\nnever seen anything like that before.\n\nWe continued to relax in the chairs, and then play some card games while we\nwaited for dinner. Barak and Neta wanted me to sit with them at dinner time so\nthe hostesses put me at their table. They also put all of the other Israeli’s\nat this table. What are you gonna do, right?\n\nI went outside to look at the stars after dinner. I swear that I could see the\nband of the Milky Way above me. If there had just been a little less light\npollution… But Chamonix in the valley floor below us was sparkling like a tiny\njewel in the night.\n\n";
