Instead, it went straight\nacross the face of Mont Tondu. Uh, ok sure, no problem, how hard can it be?Very\nhard is the answer.\n\nItaly was waiting for me as I strapped on the shoes and backpack.\n\nAlmost immediately the path turned from rocks into dirt, but not really dirt.\nMore like a slippery solid clay mixture that had flaked into a million pieces.\nEach step forced the ground out of the way as it tried to resist the force\nbeing applied to it. The feet would slip a few inches down each time I tried to\nstop level.\n\nSeveral descents did take place, but they brought me towards ever increasing\nobstacles.\n\nFirst was the 2x4 wooden beam laid across a gully that had a stream of water\nrunning underneath it with two steel ropes to hold on to as you crossed.\n\nThe ground, which was solid stone now, turned from flat into slanted and\nbulging, making the footing tricky. The trekking poles came in handy, giving me\na solid planting to push up and off from.\n\nNext came the chains that you had to climb and pull yourself up. Good thing I\nstarted doing pull-ups back at home before leaving for the trip. The third and\nfinal type of obstacle was fields of boulders with gaps in-between them. Each\nboulder moved just enough when you stepped on it to make you panic. The dark\ngaps between the rocks made you realize that they were piled high.\n\nMost of the two hour traverse of this mountainside was filled with a variation\nof these types of obstacles. Time and again I would get turned around, and have\nto search for the double yellow line marks, or a cairn, which would tell me\nthat I was back on the right path.\n\nFinally the end of this mountainside trek was here, and it was a nearly vertical\nclimb using steel cables the entire way. With a threshold of only a few inches,\nthe climb zig zagged up the side of the cliff that would bring us to the Col de\nla Seigne.\n\nAfter reaching the top and pulling myself up and over onto flat, grassy, ground\nonce more, a strange feeling washed over me. I wasn’t relieved that I had\nsurvived, no, it wasn’t that kind of feeling. It was a feeling of “I did that,\nI pushed myself and did that”. It was a feeling of triumph and personal best.\n\nDuring the morning trek, I had become separated from a pair of Golden Teapot\ntoting Swiss-germans. They were more experienced than I was, and had sped\nahead. I quickly set off on foot for the Col and to rejoin them.\n\nThe col offered beautiful views back into France, and forwards into Italy. I did\nnot stay here long since I did not see my new hiking companions. I raced down\nfrom the top. I had learned how to do fast descents on gradually sloping dirt\npaths in Spain (walk like a monkey, trust me), and made quick work of this\npart.\n\nRifugio Elisabetta was the next resting place, but again after not seeing them,\nI kept going.\n\nGlaciers and mountains surrounded me as the vegetation transitioned from grass\nto bushes to trees. A few cow herders decided that now was a good time to let\ntheir creatures cross the path. I took an alternate route to get down to the\nvalley floor because of this.\n\nOnce I got to the valley floor I turned on the after burners. Speed walking was\nmy jam, and I made quick work towards Lac Combal.\n\nThere was no sight of them along this part though, and I decided to stop speed\ntalking and save the speed, because more ascents were on the way.\n\nIt would take another three hours of up’s and downs (mostly ups) while Mont\nBlanc smiled down at me. Before I realized it I was already high above the\nvalley floor again, and the views took me by surprise. It’s hard to put these\ntypes of things in perspective until you’re either very high up or very low\ndown.\n\nMont Blanc decided to hide behind clouds for the entire afternoon, and I was\nfocused the lake dotted path in front of me, especially since the cow herds had\nreturned and were taking up most of the path. I always felt nervous when I\ntried to pass them.\n\nI ran out of water an hour from my destination, not good! But, I arrived safe\nand sound, with my reservation waiting for me. Some familiar faces gradually\narrived, along with someone from Barcelona who I had met at Auberge le Truc. I\nalso had a chance to say so-long to the Swiss-germans who were there relaxing\nbefore they would be continuing on that afternoon.\n\nThe place had beautiful views of the valley that would bring us to Courmayeur.\nPonies and horses lived at this refuge, and they came out to say hello. The\nhorses also tried to get inside in order to get at the food.\n\nDinner was delicious, the evening sky was relaxing, and the beds were\ncomfortable. I can feel a congestion in my sinuses coming on…\n\n";
