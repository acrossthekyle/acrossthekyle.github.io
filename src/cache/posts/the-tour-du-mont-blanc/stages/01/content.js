These\nincluded Torres del Paine in Patagonia, and San Jose de Maipo outside of\nSantiago, Chile. Each had around 600 meters of gain. But this was my first time\nactually hiking into, up, and over mountains.\n\nThis would be my second time in France, and Europe. My arrival into Les Houches,\nFrance on the previous day was delayed until the late evening hours. But being\nback in backpacking mode made me feel at home.\n\nDinner was in full swing when I showed up.\n\nThe host seated me at a table with a group of French speaking folks. They knew\nvery little English, but tried their best to make me feel welcomed. All of us\nwere here for the same reason: to hike the Tour du Mont Blanc.\n\nTour du Mont Blanc is a 170 kilometer (105 mile) circuit around the Mont Blanc\nmassif with an approximate height gain and loss of 10,000 meters (32,800 feet).\nIt takes you through France, Italy, and Switzerland while you spend the nights\nat various mountain huts and refuges.\n\nA chilly morning treated me to cloud covered views of Les Houches which sits\nabove a valley. The views distracted me so much, that I realized I was going\nthe wrong way. Embarrassed, I returned to the proper route up and out of the\ntown. Barely 10 minutes had gone by before I was ascending earthen steps up and\ninto the surrounding hillside.\n\nThe clouds hung around for about an hour, and made my first experience of this\nplace absolutely magical feeling.\n\nGravel paths, wood steps, and paved roads led me higher and higher. Col de Voza\nwas the first stop along the trail. It provided a great view back down into the\nvalley from which I had climbed.\n\nThe alternate route that I had chosen before embarking on this trek took me up\nthrough forests with amazing views of the valley beyond.\n\nHere I would get my first taste of having to scramble over rocks that covered\nwhat you could loosely call a trail while using a steel cable bolted into the\nrock. The drop off was so steep, that I quickly realized that this tour does\nnot mess around.\n\nSeveral signs warned us along the way that this was the “dangerous” route. Hell\nyeah, I thought. Bring it on. I would get what I asked for a short while later.\n\nMore narrow paths, steel cables, and rocks kept me moving towards a rushing\nriver that flowed down from the snow covered top of the mountain. The entrance\nto the bridge that crossed this river was precipitated by water covered rocks,\nand I slipped on them while trying to find my way down.\n\nAfter crossing the river I was climbing once more up and over rocks and steep\nswitch-back trails.\n\nThe elevation and thin air were starting to take its toll on me: each breath I\ntook became shorter and harder. I found myself taking huge gasping breaths and\nhad to stop to catch myself every 15 minutes.\n\nI started feeling nauseous as I hiked up the side of the Col de Tricot. I pulled\nout my last energy bar to give my stomach something to chew on while I pushed up\nand up.\n\nThe top did not let me down. Here I was at 2120 meters above sea level, and\ncould see a whole world set out before me.\n\nThe climb down was a long series of very steep zigzags. Most of the other\nbackpackers were going down quickly, but I had to go slowly due to my knees.\nThey never fully healed since the Camino nearly three months ago.\n\nIn the valley below me stood the small Chalets de Miage. I arrived nearly two\nhours later, and grabbed lunch. It was already 2pm and my destination was\nfurther ahead.\n\nEven though I was happy to have gone up to the top of the stage, and come back\ndown again, I still had to put another 300 meters of gain under my belt before\nI could call the day done.\n\nAt 3:30 pm I found myself at my place of residence for the night at Auberge de\nTruc. It was a true mountain refuge. Their milk came from the cows they owned,\nthere were no lights in the dormitory, outhouse bathroom, or at the sinks, and\nthere were no showers.\n\nBut none of that mattered. I did this, I accomplished all of this, and that was\nthe best feeling in the world.\n\nOne of the things that I loved most about the Camino was the people you met.\nThis trip had the same aspect to it. Dinner was around 7pm in the evening, and\nI got to meet a couple from Germany, a man from South Korea, and a lady from\nSpain.\n\nThe setting sun called us outside after dinner. It was striking the top of Dome\nde Miage and covering it in the brightest pink and orange colors that I’ve ever\nseen on a mountain.\n\nLife in the mountains is so peaceful and quiet. The sound of the cowbells didn’t\neven bother me, and helped to play a soothing role in putting me to sleep later\nthat night.\n\n";
