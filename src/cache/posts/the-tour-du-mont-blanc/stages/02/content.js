The pictures do\nnot capture the steepness of the trail. I would be walking, hiking, and pulling\nmyself up through all different types of things today.\n\nMountain sleeping is some of the best sleeping that I’ll ever have. My bunk was\nnext to the door, so I had to contend with people going in and out to use the\nbathroom in the middle of the night, but the cold air helped me sleep. I also\nhad an empty bunk next to me, so I didn’t have to worry about someone snoring\nin my face.\n\nSince I stayed up high last night, I had to start the day by descending down 750\nmeters to the city of Les Contamines below. It only took about an hour and half\nto descend through the winding roads and twisting trails. I got lost twice as I\ntried to find my way into the city center.\n\nThe way out of town went through a forest that followed a river for most of the\nway. It was a shallow trail, not much gain in elevation. Saw one of the cutest\nhouses that I’ve ever seen next to the chapel of Notre-Dame de la Gorge.\n\nHere the trail started to go up, passing by various little waterfalls along the\nway. One of these watery distractions was a river of a deep blue that cut right\ndown the middle of the forest through a canyon of its own design.\n\nSeveral old buildings dotted the land around the trail as I continued on. I took\na short breather at Refuge Nant Borrant since I had just climbed about 500\nmeters. From here on out the trail would become much steeper, and the elevation\ngain much more rapid.\n\nOver the next hour I would hike along a gravel path, passing cows, red-roofed\nhouses, rivers, and spotting what looked like the Torres del Paine in the\ndistance (somehow I must have walked to Patagonia).\n\nI met up with some folks from the night before at Refuge de la Balme\n(1760 meters) and we all started the next steep part together. It’s always a\ngood idea to stop and turn around every so often though, because the views\nbehind are almost just as amazing as the views ahead. I did this many times\nduring the steep hike, simply because I wanted to see where I had come from.\nThis helped put todays struggle into perspective.\n\nWe moved closer and closer to the clouds as we made the hike up to Col du\nBonhomme. I got separated from the people I had been walking with (I can’t\nremember if I pulled ahead or fell behind), so I did the last couple of hours\non my own.\n\nI didn’t spend much time here at this Col. It took 600 meters to get here, so I\ndefinitely took a bit of a break. I took a walk around the col, snapping\npictures and admiring the view, but I knew that there was more in store for me\nand I would have to wait just a little bit longer on the “job well done”.\n\nThe next and final Col for the day was Col de la Croix.\n\nNow came the boulders, steep drop-offs, and narrow paths. It took every last\nounce of power that I had left to navigate these parts. I was in a\nno-fucking-around mood and did just that: powered through them.\n\nThe refuge for the night was a sight for sore (literally) eyes as I started the\n40 meter descent towards it. I arrived just in time before the clouds rolled in\nand visibility dropped to zero.\n\nTook my first cold shower tonight. What an experience that was. I’d rather go\nstinky than do a cold shower again.\n\nThis place also ran on solar power, and since it had been cloudy all day, that\nmeant no lights which meant using your head torch to find your way around. But\nit also meant eating dinner by candlelight, not too bad. I hung out with some\nIsraelis (Barak and Neta) before dinner, and some folks from the UK, Canada,\nBrazil, and Ireland during dinner.\n\nWhy is French bread so dry??\n\nThe setting sun lit up a mountain in the distance in soft purples, and the sky\nbehind the hills opposite it in bright oranges.\n\nTomorrow would be the highest hike yet for me, and the most meters gained and\nlost so far, which could have been avoided had I known about a shortcut across\nthe mountain top...\n\n";
