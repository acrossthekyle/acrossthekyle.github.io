The pedestal\nmarking the highest point on the TMB, and the various peaks in the distance,\nwas covered in ice. But that didn't matter to us while we removed our outer\nlayers. The valley below seemed like another world, so very far away. Today\nwould be a marathon of hiking.\n\nThe Germans and I left Bonhomme around 7:30 in the morning. Our collective goal\nwas an Official highpoint of the TMB on the Col des Fours, and then back down.\nWe accomplished this goal an hour later: Col de Fours at 2,665m.\n\nAn optional trail offered to take us to the summit of Tête Nord de Fours in the\ndistance, but we declined and decided to save the energy for the descent, and\nmy own energy for the climb I would be doing later this afternoon.\n\nSteep, slanted, rock carried us down from the pedestal and back into the\ncrevices of the mountains. Throw in a little water, and it became a slipping\nchallenge. You can try and look graceful, but it isn’t going to happen. Fall on\nyour butt and welcome the chance to try again.\n\nThe green ground rushed up to meet us as we descended, with rivers rushing next\nto us falling over edges in little waterfalls. Splinters of rock began to make\nup most of the path floor.\n\nCows dotted the valley below us. It was an entire field full of cowbells. They\nignored us, until their owner arrived and started shouting. She was herding\nthem towards our small group. By now our numbers had swelled from 3 to 9 as we\npicked up more hikers on the way down.\n\nThe cows still didn’t care about us, and would have rightfully ran right through\nour ranks if we didn’t move out of the way. They had a place to be, and the\nherding dog wasn’t letting any of them get out of line, or take a break.\n\nEventually they were above us as we continued down the narrow dirt path cut into\nthe side of the earth.\n\nWe must have missed an official turn on the path, because we ended up\nbushwhacking over fields, and passed by abandoned farm houses. Our trusty\nnavigators who held The Map kept telling us to just follow this path, and we\ntrusted them. After a few shortcuts (the path kept looping back on itself so we\ncut down the sides on some of the declines) we came back to a paved road which\ntook us all the way down to Ville des Glaciers.\n\nAfter a short break I was forced to say goodbye to some as I needed to take a\ndifferent route than they were. Most of us had the same schedules, so I knew I\nwas going to see them again.\n\nThe walk up and out of Refuge des Mottets wasn’t that bad, but I knew the worse\nwas still to come. My home for the night was a tiny brown dot on a gray\nmountainside nearly 1,000 meters above me.\n\nI had to stop and breath many times as I made the ascent. Several waterfalls\ncrossed my path, and after making good time initially I started to slow down.\nBut, I pushed on up and over the rocks, letting cairns and rocks on the ground\nguide my way.\n\nSee if you can spot the brown dot in the distance in the first picture Slowly\nbut surely that tiny brown dot on side of mountain became a building. I made it\nto Refuge Robert Blanc. Now it was time to relax.\n\nI really wish I had brought a book with me for when I was relaxing at these\nrefuges. The downtime at these places can feel very long and slow. There are no\ntowns to explore, and you don’t really want to do anymore hiking or walking for\nthe day.\n\nThe clouds rolled in shortly before dinner, and covered the whole mountainside\nfor the remainder of the night. We ate a hearty meal, and made some new\nfriends.\n\nDuring dinner I found out about shortcut that went across the top of the\nmountains. It was the optional trail that went up to Tête Nord de Fours. It\ncontinued up and over and was a straight shot to the refuge. Oops.\n\nI love being up this high, removed from everything below. But, I had no idea\njust how hard tomorrows hike was going to be.\n\n";
