Most of the ascent was done from\nwithin the cover of trees, so I didn’t get a good look at the receding village\nor valley floor as I went up.\n\nOnce above the trees the views returned to me. Oh how I missed them. I don’t\nthink I’ll ever get used to seeing the sides of mountains as they shoot towards\nthe ground below them.\n\nSeveral pink flowers dotted the landscape, as well as an abandoned house, as I\ncontinued on up to the loneliest looking of buildings at the Col de Balme.\n\nIt was here at Refuge du Col de Balme that the Swiss world blended in with the\nFrench world. Switzerland on one side, and France on another. Borders exist\nonly on paper. In nature, they are invisible and there is no distinction from\none side of a field to another. Except for this one, because dead ahead was the\nmassif of Mont Blanc. It had taken nearly 9 days, but we were finally in sight\nof it once more.\n\nWe worked our way down and across the tops of rolling hills towards the Aig des\nPosettes, the high point of todays hike. It was a mostly easy hike up to the\ntop, with only minor scrambling at some points.\n\nAbove us hang gliders had taken to the skies as we sat down on the rocky ground\nand broke out our snacks: chocolate, banana chips, more chocolate, and some\nnuts.\n\nI can’t believe that this trek is almost over. There’s only a few more days on\nthe TMB. It has been an amazing experience and journey so far.\n\nThe hike down wasn’t that bad, but it was just as tough as some of the others.\nIt wasn’t long before we were safely under the cover of the trees again. The\nsun was high in the sky by this point and it was shaping up to be a warm day.\nMore switchbacks as we made our way down. I was glad that the ground changed\nfrom rock to sandy dirt to leaves. It made the impact of the foot with the\nground a lot easier to handle.\n\nWe found our way easily enough to the Auberge for the night. I said goodbye to\nLaura (USA) since she was continuing on to another town and ending her hike a\nday early.\n\nI learned to play Taki (the Israel version of Uno), and had a good dinner with\nsome Dutch people. Learned that tafle is Dutch for table.\n\nThe setting sun lit up the sky in a bright purple, and the mountains glowed a\nbeautiful pink.\n\n";
