I took my time\nleaving in the morning, and I think I was the last one to leave.I took a\nleisurely pace as I get on the trail walking under ski lifts, and over gently\nsloping forest paths.\n\nThere were a couple of boulder patches blocking the path, and these ones had a\nmuch, much, steeper drop below them than the ones I had previously walked\nacross. The pictures don’t do it justice.\n\nOn the other side of the field of rocks lay a massive stone wall. It had no\nname, and the guidebook didn’t mention it, but it was impressive. Just after\nthis wall we came to a red plastic pole that was in the middle of the path\nahead of us.\n\nSome of the other hikers thought that it meant we couldn’t go that way, and\nwould have to take a higher alternative route. I nearly shit my pants when the\nthought of having to do strenuous work today entered my mind. I thought I was\npassed it all.\n\nI started up the alternate path, walking more quickly than the others, and was\nsoon far ahead of them. I was nearly at the top when I looked back and saw\neveryone else turning around to go along the normal path! Apparently it was\nopen for business. I was a little upset that I had come all this way only to\nturn back, but in the end I was glad that I noticed them turning around.\n\nAs a result of this, I was now far behind everyone. But, I would quickly catch\nup.\n\nThe path curved around the hillside and at certain points it looked like the\npath went off into nothing. Beautiful rays of light and clouds illuminated the\ntrail ahead of me. At one point it looked like an asteroid was about to strike\nthe mountain due to the clouds and sun playing tricks on my eyes.\n\nA short while later I came to a ski lift landing area, and saw where they had\nbeen launching all of the hang gliders! It was quite a sight to see them get\ntheir running start and jump off of the edge without hesitation.\n\nBut now the hardest part of today would begin: climbing up to the top of Le\nBrevént at 2,526m. I was not prepared for this, but took it in stride\n(literally). Two hours and several more shaky rocks and ladders later I was at\nthe top.\n\nIt had an impressive view of Mont Blanc across the valley, and there was even a\nski lift that came all of the way up here! Even though Mont Blanc itself was\nstill 2,000m taller than this spot, it felt like we were even with its top.\n\nThe hike down was rough, and felt never-ending. I raced down as fast as I could\ngo, especially since there were lots of people talking and I wanted to enjoy\nthe peace and quiet.\n\nI arrived at Bellechat two hours later, and was the first to check in. It was\nsuch a little refuge that I thought I had made a mistake in booking it, and not\ncontinuing down to Les Houches like everyone else. Luckily my fears were abated\nwhen several more people started to check in over the next couple of hours.\n\nA group of people from Holland kept my company throughout most of the evening,\ntelling me their life story and teaching me some more Dutch words. I never knew\nso many European countries made English a required subject for all of their\nyears of pre-university schooling. We played card some Dutch and English games\nwaiting for dinner.\n\nIt was very quiet up here once all of the hikers for the day had moved on, and\nthe dinner was very delicious. After dinner they took turns telling stories\nabout their families during World War 2.\n\nI turned in early tonight, not looking forward to actually finishing tomorrow.\n\n";
