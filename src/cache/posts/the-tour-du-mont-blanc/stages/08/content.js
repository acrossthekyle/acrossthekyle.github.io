Hiking through the\nwoods in the early morning hours with the sun streaming through the trees is\none of the most magical things that you can hope to see in nature.I took my\ntime walking today, and made sure to see everything.\n\nThe first 30 minutes were easy because I had already gone this way at least\nthree times last night! I knew where to go, and which routes to take.\n\nOnce I reached the flat ground that entered the mountains I took a break to\nremove my jacket and get ready. I figured it would take me a couple of hours to\nget to the top, but it ended up taking three.\n\nI was making for the Fenetre d’Arpette at 2,665m. This is also the other highest\npoint on the TMB (but not an official one since it’s optional and not\nrecommended).\n\nThe first half of the trek was through woods before quickly turning into shrubs\nand low sparse trees. Colors of all kinds accompanied me as I crossed over\nrivers, pulled myself up over boulders, and went up into the mountains. I\nturned around once at least every 10 minutes to snap a picture of the ever\nincreasing field of view behind me.\n\nSoon enough all forms of large vegetation where gone, and we were left with crab\ngrass and rocks. And even then that was gone within 30 minutes and all that was\nleft were bare rocks.\n\nThe scariest part of todays hike and climb came upon me just below the summit. A\nfield of boulders, some the size of camper vans, lay between me and my goal.\n\nI had walked/hiked over fields of small boulders a few days earlier when I had\nleft Robert Blanc for Italy. These were different. The average size was much\ngreater, and these guys moved a lot more than those did.\n\nI avoided all distractions (hence no pictures of this) as I went up. I kept a\nwatchful eye out for the white and red strips that told you which way to go.\nSeveral cairns that were placed along the way also helped.\n\nAt one point I had to hug a boulder the size of my bedroom as I inched my way\naround it.\n\nSeveral of these rocks also required you to climb up them, only to realize you\nwent the wrong way, and then you had to find a scary alternate way around\nthem.\n\nOnce I got passed the field of rocks, I turned around to stay back in wonder and\namazement. Second scariest obstacle had been overcome!\n\nOn the way up the steep zig-zag path to the top I came upon Barak and Neta. We\nshared lunch and picture taking at the top, and sat there for nearly an hour,\ntaking it all in.\n\nThey say that they way down is harder than the way up sometimes, and this time\nthey were correct. While the fight up meant dealing with shifting boulders the\nsize of cars, the fight down meant fighting one of the steepest and sloppiest\ndescents to date.\n\nA massive glacier (Glacier du Trient) occupied our view to the left, along with\nthe massive smooth rock that it had created during its life.\n\nI quickly lost patience after we got through the scariest part of the descent,\nand started to hurry down to the river below. I started jumping down at certain\nparts (which is not a good idea when you have bad knees). For some reason I\njust wanted to be done with the descent. In total it took three hours to get\ndown.\n\nI waited for the others to catch up at a bar near the river just outside of\ntown. It was filled with locals, but they were used to seeing backpackers come\ndown from the mountains.\n\nFinally, by 3:30pm we were on our way to our rest spot for the night: Refuge du\nPeuty. I cannot recommend this place enough.\n\nThe two women who run this place make dinner for you in an old washing machine\n(not kidding), and play the best music during dinner which is made from\ningredients grown on their property. I’m not kidding when I say that our dinner\nhad actual flowers cooked into it.\n\n";
