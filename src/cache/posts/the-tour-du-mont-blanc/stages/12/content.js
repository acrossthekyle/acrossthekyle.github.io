Several Ibex also\nkept me company as I hiked down. On the way, I stopped by the Le Christ Roi. It\nwas a humungous statue that came out of nowhere.\n\nI finished the last few hundred meters pretty effortlessly as I crossed over the\nriver, and passed the train station. I was now back where I started, and it\nfelt like a lifetime ago. My hiking boots and backpack were no longer black,\nbut instead were covered with the dirt of several different mountainsides.\n\nThe gîte that I would be staying at wasn’t open until 4pm or so, so I had some\ntime to kill. I walked around the town, grabbed some souvenir maps, and visit\nall of the gift shops.\n\nOn my second or third pass through the town center I ran into four other hikers\nthat I had met along the way! We grabbed some drinks and lunch at the only open\nhotel bar and shared numerous stories with each other.\n\nA wicked rain storm came out of nowhere and forced us inside. But, it was time\nto say goodbye and go check in.\n\nAfter checking in I ran into people whom I had met on day 1! This was crazy! One\nof them lent me their free bus pass to go over to Chamonix in order to search\nfor a pin for my backpack. I wanted to build up a collection of pins from hikes\nthat I have done or will do, and wanted them to be adorned on my backpack.\n\nChamonix is a massive tourist town, and I hurried up and down the long stretch\nof shops and restaurants. I must have seen all that they had to offer, which is\na lot.\n\nTwo of the coolest people I met on the trip found me as I was speed walking\naround: Barak and Neta from Israel. It was great to see them one last time now\nthat we were back in civilization.\n\nFinally I found my pin at a random shop at the end of the street. Satisfied with\nmy purchase I returned to the bus stop in order to get back in time for\ndinner.\n\nThe group that was staying there (from day one) had been at a bar the entire\ntime and came to dinner very tipsy. It made for a very interesting meal: a\ncarafe of wine was spilled during the course of it. We hung out in the common\nroom after dinner, and then said goodnight.\n\nI left for the airport early in the morning, and looked out longingly at the\nmountains as the shuttle sped past them on the expressway.\n\nWhile this trek wasn’t as intense as the Camino, it was still special in its own\nway, along with its own challenges. I accomplished so many feats of strength\nthat I had never had to worry about before, and it left me as a stronger\nperson.\n\nI love Europe, and can’t wait to come back!\n\n";
