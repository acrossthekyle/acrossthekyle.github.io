I was eager to check it out, and to make today just a little harder\nbecause, you know, gotta get the steps in!\n\nThe way out of town was a little unsure to us, but thanks to my new Catalonian\nfriend we found our way out. After leaving the town center, and paved road, we\nwere immediately walking through the forest and down towards a river crossing.\n\nAfter the river crossing, which was surrounded by concrete walls and served as a\nmini dam, we were back in the woods. The sun had not fully cleared the tops of\nthe mountains to our right as we continued Northbound and came to the path\nleading to the waterfall.\n\nWhat looked like a mostly flat path ended up being very steep and slippery,\nthanks to the morning dew. But the journey was well worth the reward. I had to\nscramble a bit near the top, just below where the water was striking the\nground. I was terrified that the slightest misstep would land me in the pool of\nrocks and water below me. But I was able to get close enough to feel the water\nspraying on my face.\n\nI was tempted to stick my head into the waterfall, but scared at the last\nmoment. It wasn’t easy moving around up there, and I had already slipped way to\nmany times on the wet rocks trying to get close. I wasn’t going to push my luck\nknowing my history of clumsiness.\n\nSeveral of the people we knew had arrived at the bottom of the path as I was\nbeginning to make my way down. We all walked together for the rest of the day.\n\nMost of the path went along a massive dried up river, twisting and winding it’s\nway through the forest. Several times the trail would leave no room for error\nas we crossed narrow paths which sometimes had a chain to hold on to, and a\nnice 100 foot drop below you.\n\nAfter taking a right angle turn away from the valley wall, and walking down a\ngently rolling path, we found ourselves entering the town of Praz-de-Fort. We\nwere now officially in Swiss valley villages. Small village after small village\ngreeted us as we walked a mostly paved path through the valley floor.\n\nEach house was a perfect little wooden masterpiece that evoked rest and\nrelaxation. There was a good mix of new/modern houses, and old barn style\nhouses that looked like they might fall over at the slightest touch.\n\nAfter the third village we decided to rest at a cute little bar/cafe in Issert.\nI gave in and bought an ice cream sandwich while we sat on the porch and stared\nat the greenery around us.\n\nNow it was time to begin the steepest part of the “climb”. Really it was only\n1.5 hours of going up, and probably less than 500 m in total gain. We passed a\ncave along the way and ventured inside to explore.\n\nThere were also many wood carvings in the forest on this ascent. Mushrooms\n(lots of mushrooms), antelope, beaver sculptures greeted us from time to time.\nWe even passed a spot where some locals were scaling the rocky side of a mini\nmountain outcropping.\n\nBut the arrival into Campex and its lake was easy, and before long we were all\nsitting down at a bar eating pizza and drinking beers. After a couple of hours\nit was time to make the way to our separate places of residence for the night.\n\nThe day took a turn for the worse after leaving the lake behind and going our\nseparate ways for our accommodations. I got lost, four times! Well, technically\nyou can only get lost once, but I took four different routes to try and find\nthe Gite that I was going to be staying at.\n\nMy first attempt was to head up an alternate path that everyone swore would take\nme to where I needed to be, but it was an alternate path that led up to the\nwrong Refuge (this one was were two of the people I knew were staying).\n\nOn the way down I asked an old Swiss lady whose only advice was to wave her\nhands in circles. I then tried to follow a river, because, you know, they lead\nto civilization. That didn’t work, and I ended up doubling back to the place\nwhere I had met the old Swiss lady.\n\nFinally I ran in to a group of young adults (probably in high school) and asked\nthem where to go. Luckily one of them spoke enough English to point me in the\nproper direction. Thank you random group of people, where ever you are!\n\nThankfully the Gite was a delight, and I ended up having dinner with my new\nSouth Korean friend. He tried his best to teach me basic Korean. Sadly, the\nonly thing I remember is Annyeonghaseyo (roughly pronounced on-yo-his-ay-o).\n\nIt was a delightful evening to erase the scariness of getting lost, and to learn\na little bit in the process about another culture, and my fortitude in the face\nof adversity.\n\n";
