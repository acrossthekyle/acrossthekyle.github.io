export const content = "<Stats />\n\n<Route />\n\nWay before I set foot on the Camino in Spain, I had already committed to doing\na thru-hike called the Tour du Mont Blanc. The Camino was my first time\nin Europe, let alone my first thru-hike/backpacking trip ever, and yet I had\ndetermined that I would like it so much that I would want to do another not\ntwo months later. Sounds crazy, right?\n\nLuckily, I was enamored with thru-hiking thanks to a great experience on the\nCamino. So, even though this trip was two months away, I was already counting\ndown the days until I returned to Europe.\n\n## What is the Tour du Mont Blanc\n\nThe Tour du Mont Blanc, or TMB, is a hiking route that encircles the Mont Blanc\nmountain in the Alpes, passing through three different countries: France,\nItaly and Switzerland. It's around 100 miles long, with a lot of elevation\ngain/loss. It's also considered a classic long-distance hiking trail.\n\n<World\n  markers={[\n    {\n      left: '47.1%',\n      top: '20%',\n    },\n  ]}\n/>\n\n## Where I spent each night\n\nAlong the route there were places called Refuges in the mountains where I\nspent the night. Amenities varied at each place, but they usually included a\nbed with blankets, a full bathroom setup, and meals that can be ordered\na-la-carte. I paid full price for my bookings which meant breakfast and\ndinner were included.\n\nAll of them had to be purchased in advance in order to guarantee a place to\nstay.\n\n<Gallery images={['2018/09/02/9db619fd-6863-4212-a2c9-45ae544ec78f.jpeg']} title=\"Refuge Robert Blanc\" />\n\n## What I brought\n\nI used the same gear from the Camino, and it worked out pretty well. Here's a\nbrief list of some of the items that I had to bring in order to make this a\nsuccessful hike:\n\n<Checklist\n  items={[\n    'Sleeping bag liner',\n    'Power bank',\n    'Pillow',\n    'Refuge outfit',\n    'Hut slippers',\n    'Water filter',\n    'Headlamp',\n    'Trekking poles',\n    'Entertainment',\n  ]}\n/>\n\nThe refuges won't let you stay there without a sleeping bag liner (in order\nto help prevent the spread of bed bugs), and slippers (i.e. some pair of\nfootwear other than the shoes you've been hiking in all day). Entertainment is\nimportant because you could have a lot of free time on your hands. I brought a\nbook to read, and some playing cards.\n\nI wasn't sure what I would be able to do, physically, so I bought a guidebook\nand used that to help me plan my trip. Availability also had an influence\nsince I booked my stays late in the booking season. Because of the variety\nand locations of places to stay, I broke the route down into the stages below.\n\n<Stages />\n\nThe TMB was said to be one of the most popular\nlong-distance walks in Europe, and they weren't kidding. There was a good\namount of people on it when I went, and I met some great people.\nBackpackers/thru-hikers are definitely my kind of people. It's an awesome\nfeeling to be part of a larger group that is all working towards the same goal.\n\nThis thru-hike, just like the Camino, did not disapoint. The sights are\namazing, and the effort I put in during each day made every sight and sound\nworth it.\n\nI can't wait to do this one again.\n\n";
