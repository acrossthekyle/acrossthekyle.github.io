        Processing times vary, and can take up to 5-9 business days, but most
        items are usually shipped within 6 business days or fewer. Shipping
        times can also vary, depending on the shipping address.

        If, for any reason, your print arrives damaged or misprinted (does not
        apply to ordering the wrong size, or simply changing your mind), I will
        gladly provide you with a one-time replacement without any additional
        fees after providing proof of damage/misprint. You must reach out within
        30 days of product delivery. After 30 days no replacements will be
        provided.

        A printing partner (Printful) is used for the production and shipping of
        items.
