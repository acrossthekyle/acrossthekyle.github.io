The trail leads into the legendary landscape of the Northern Italian Alps to admire incredible landscapes all along the way. The Dolomites are a mountain range that features some of the most stunning mountain landscapes in the world with sheer cliffs, narrow, deep and long valleys and steep vertical walls.",
      "When I first started exploring the world of thru-hikes, this trail kept appearing on every list I found, and for good reason: it's an amazingly-beautiful trek without being too challenging, and it had some of the best meals of any thru-hike I've ever done."

      "The Camino de Santiago (also known was Camino or 'The Way') is an ancient network of trails leading to the city of Santiago de Compostela in northwestern Spain. They start from all over Europe, and have been continously in use since medieval times. The most popular route is the Camino Frances which goes from the border of France all the way to the Atlantic ocean. It's a roughly 500 mile journey by foot, and the experience was a spiritual retreat from modern life. Along the Way I stayed in a variety of places, from hostel-like Albergues to church attics."
