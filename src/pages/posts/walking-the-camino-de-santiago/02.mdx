The chirping of birds filled the dormitory room as I rolled onto my side and
pushed myself up from the bottom of the bunk bed. After randomly shoving things
into my bag I did one last check before heading downstairs.

After grabbing what looked like edible (and hopefully healthy) food from the
vending machine I retrieved my boots from the smelly storage room, placed my
backpack on a bench in the inner courtyard, and took a step out the front door.

Chilly morning air greeted me as I stood there in front of the rolling hills
and mountains that we conquered yesterday. The world here was calm, and relaxed.

The others had arrived downstairs when I returned to fetch my bag. With food
in bags, shoes tied, and light jackets on, we set out.

We (Amy and I) were forced to walk in the street due to the mud-filled paths
leading away from the Monastery. The road took us through a small town a few
kilometers away from Roncesvalles. We found our way down a small slope at the
end of the village, and returned to the trail with trees on our left, and cows
on our right. We tried talking to the horses but they weren't being very
responsive.

I stopped for a brief moment to turn around and take in the sunrise as it
crested over the hills behind us. 30 minutes later we were heading into another
quiet town. We took a short break at the only cafe that was open.
The path took us back in to the trees, and up more hills. Our conversation
returned to where it had left ended from the previous day. Music kept us company
as we spent the next hour hiking through dense woods with open grass prairies
appearing through breaks in the trees.

This day was full of ups and downs and all of it was beautiful and breathtaking.
Sometimes it is hard to enjoy the amazing world around you when you have to
fight for every step. I wish I had taken it all in with more frequent stops.

A small stream followed us along the concrete path as we descended. The stream
eventually got louder and bigger until finally we were upon a river with its
water rushing over the concrete. In order to cross this water we had to step
along the tops of short concrete pillars that acted somewhat like a dam.

On the other side of this river the path led up to a bar on the side of the
road, and we didn't hesitate. 9:30 am on a Sunday was the perfect time for beer
and wine when you're on the early days of the Camino.

The terrain around us alternated between bare rock and dense trees. Eventually
we came to a fork in the path, and the break in the trees gave us a perfect
view of the tree-covered hills in the distance. Nothing but hills and trees as
far as we could see with blue skies, and white clouds hovering near the horizon.

At this point we had started on our way down towards Zubiri.

The ground became unrelenting with the bedrock turned up at a 45 degree angle,
and each edge of each protruding rock looking like a razor sharp knife. These
parts were also covered with slippery mud.

Up ahead on the other side of a curve in the highway was a small snack stand.
It had a basket for women to donate their underwear, and the reward for your
donation was a wish being granted to you that you would meet your future husband
on this Camino. No underwear was donated, but we grabbed some food and relaxed.
Familiar faces started to arrive at the rest stop as we grabbed a table in the
shade.

Our time here was short since we were eager to finish today's route. After
another two hours of hiking, and nearly rolling my ankle a dozen times, we
arrived in Zubiri.

Upon entering the town over the bridged river, we got lost trying to find the
place that we would hopefully be staying at. Eventually we found our way and
grabbed some beds at the small and cozy municipal Albergue.

The local cafe was called Estrella Galicia and we headed there to wait for the
others to arrive. The clouds had begun to roll in, and shortly after it began
to rain. Luckily our friends arrived just before the heavy rain started to fall.
While we sheltered from the rain in the cafe we met some new friends.

This night would be the first real night on the Camino: no longer would we be
sheltered by modern conveniences. The walled fort-city that is famous for
running with the bulls at Pamplona was waiting for us, and I was eager to begin
the next days hike through more green hills.
