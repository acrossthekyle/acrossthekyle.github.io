The air was crisp and fresh, as all early summer mornings should be, as I tied
my shoes, stood up, slung my backpack over my shoulders, and stepped out the
front door.

I'm standing on the Rue de la Citadelle in St-Jean-Pied-de-Port in shoes that
aren't broken in, and a hat from Lollapalooza. It’s a cold brisk morning on
June 2nd, 2018 and I’m about to start the Camino de Santiago.

As I stood there in the early morning light on the street I tried to take stock
of what I had come here to do, and what was about to happen. I stared down the
road, watching other pilgrims march up the stone-paved road and off into the
distance, before finally muttering to myself "alright, let's go."

To be honest, I really didn't know which way to go, so I blindly followed three
pilgrims who were walking side-by-side further ahead of me. The sun was shining,
and the clouds were few and far between, as we left the village behind and
entered the countryside.

Shortly after I cleared the final threshold of buildings that separated the
man-made world from natural world, the three ladies whom I had been following
suddenly stopped. As I was walking past them, now confident in the way to go,
and I overheard one of them ask out loud "Is this the right way?" I offered the
best advice that I could give: "Yeah, I think so."

And that's all it took. I came to France alone but this pilgrimage, which
started barely 30 minutes ago, was no longer a solo trip, and I had made new
friends. They were: Amy (USA), Martha (UK), and Tracey (AUS).

We left the stone-paved village roads behind, gradually rising above the clouds
with each step. Every time I turned around to stare in awe at the view in
front of my eyes it seemed like I was becoming further separated from the world.

Gradually our group splintered while we were walking and talking.

After a while the topic of conversation turned to "Why are you walking across
Spain?". I suddenly realized that I didn't know and my mind started to cloud
with answers as I tried to formulate something. Hopefully I'll find an answer
to that question as this adventure continues.

Around mid-morning we arrived at Orisson. We were in desperate need of a break
since none of us were prepared for how much constant uphill walking was
involved. After resting and refueling on water we returned to the trail. The
clouds had followed us, and we were treated to cool temperatures and fog-filled
paths.

Shortly thereafter the fog left us and we were back to staring at the curving
paved road as we continued up the mountainside. Each time I saw a curve ahead
of us, and the road disappeared behind it, I hoped that this must be the top.

The marked way left the paved road behind shortly before reaching the border
of Spain, near the top.

Here the fog returned to us and clung to the trees, covering the path in the
far distance. It would still be another hour of following the road up and around
the mountain forest before we would come to a marker signifying that the way
down had begun. After more than five hours of ascending, we were finally on
the descent and in Spain.

It took all of my concentration to stay vertical, and to keep my feet from
getting stuck in the mud. The trees were dense here, and the air heavy. We
nearly bushwhacked our way through the forest, loosing the trail and then
finding it a few moments later each time.

Shortly before exiting the woods, and entering Roncesvalles, I managed to
slip and fall on my ass.

I have never been happier to see a destination. It meant clean clothes, hot
showers, and companionship with the people that you struggled all day with.
The air was filled only with the sounds of birds chirping, pilgrims arriving and
cleaning off their shoes, and the energy of conversation filling the dormitory
halls.

With our belly's full from a three course meal we said our goodbyes and
retreated back to the monastery dorms. We found the others sitting at the
entrance to our floor and spent the next hour talking, laughing, and getting
to know each other.

Tomorrow meant more downhill hiking as we would begin descending the Pyrenees
and make our way for Zubiri. Hopefully the rains will stay away and keep the
path dry for us.
