The day after. I slept better in the purchased tent than I would have in my
tent, that's for sure. The wind howled all night, and the rain didn't let up. I
couldn't stretch out fully in the tent, so I had to lay at an angle and/or curl
up for most of the night. I packed up my backpack from inside the tent, which
was a nice touch (I coudn't do that in mine, not enough roof). These purchasable
tents are daylight and bomb proof though; I opened the flap to a nice sun-filled
and calm morning, nothing like last night.

The trail started off going up mountain ridges with minor scrambling here and
there as we hiked over ridge peak after ridge peak. These ridges and their
highs and lows looked deceptively small from far away, and seemed like they
would be easy to do, but once I got closer they were much greater than from
far away. I got lost a couple of times, simply becaues the markers were
difficult to find in certain areas.

Once the ridge portion was done it was time to go down a muddy series of
switchbacks towards the woods below. I was in good spirits as I raced down
this area. After that the trail started to level out, and go through a small
strand of trees. Finally, some easy trail!

These trees gave way to gently rolling green hills dotted with large boulders,
and I could see far into the distance: this would be the trail for a good long
while today, which was nice. I was making great time as well. There weren't
kidding when they said the southern portion was much easier than the northern.

Here and there large rivers and streams cut across the path, with some watery
crossings along the way. These were some of the greenest areas of the trail that
I had seen so far on this trip. After the river portion was done it was time to
head through local farmers fields and past some other non-refuge places that
people could stay at. I could have stopped for breakfast, but it didn't look
like they were open for non-guest visitors just yet, so I kept going.

The trail was so easy today.

Up and around a series of twists and turns through lush vegetation and I came
to an abandoned house with plant-life of all colors around it. And not a trail
marker in sight. It took me and one other stranger a few random attempts of
searching in multiple directions before we found the markers and the resuming
of the trail. Shortly after resuming the trail I came upon a refuge that I had
orinally planned on staying at, and I'm glad I didn't. It was so bare and plain
looking. I did stop though to rest and change out my bandaids on my blisters and
snack on the food I bought the previous night. On the way out some cows were
blocking the path and I had to take a long detour around them.

The trail was now a dirt and gravel road for a while, but it turned off of here
eventually and it went through some very green land with a small river
running through it. Once past that there was another place to stay and eat, and
I decided to try and get some lunch here and found a good spot at a table in the
shade. Unfortunately I struck out: the kitchen wasn't open yet and wouldn't be
for another hour or so. Disheartened I picked up my backpack and got back on
trail.

For the remainder of the afternoon the trail would go up at a steady rate,
mostly along a road again before turning off it and going back into nature. The
landscape was very hilly and dotted with small boulders. It was a lovely sight.
I was making amazing time time, doing two stages in one again. Eventually a
large section of ascending to the high point of the day came up and this was
the hardest part.

I didn't think the southern portion had any elevation points as high as the one
I had just completed. It was nearly 6,500 feet above sea-level, and was up in
the clouds. I couldn't see the refuge from way up here, but I'm sure it was
down there somewhere. The descent was one of the worst though, especially after
doing a double-stage day. My knees were killing me. I made it to the refuge 1
hour earlier than the official time the signs along the way said it would take!

I'm glad this will be the last night of trying to pick a good tent spot and trying
to get the tent pitch perfect, because after getting it set up and getting in
it I realized there was a dip on the right side. I had to use a plank of wood
to level it out, somewhat. It's working so far. I also had to resort to stuffing
some clothes under one end of the air mattress. Not my best set up.

Dinner here was delicious, and my stuff stayed dry overnight even though some
clouds had decided to move in during dinner. There wasn't much to do up here,
or many communal places to sit, and the temps were dropping gast, so I spent
most of the night reading in my tent.
