Hello, my name's Kyle, and I am a thru-hiker/programmer based in
Chicago with my partner and our dog Dax. I've been on several
thru-hikes all around the world, from South America to Nepal, and I've
been programming continously since 2010. I like to refer to it as
"designing code", and it allows me to live this life. As a
hobby/side-project I made some apps for garmin smartwatches.

### Thru-Hiking

My first experience with thru-hiking was the Camino de Santiago, a 500
mile trail, or Way (as it's called), in Northern Spain. It was a
33-day journey across the country, full of new experiences and
hardships, and I met so many amazing people on it. There was nothing
quiet like carrying everything I needed on my back, while walking
across open land from village to village, day after day. Yes my feet
hurt (a lot), but I discovered what I was capable of, and I
experienceed the world in a unique way while meeting all kinds of
people from all walks of life (no pun intended).

Needless to say, I was hooked &mdash; I've done 7 thru-hikes, and
summitted 9 mountain peaks, in addition to having traveled to more
than a dozen countries. My favorite places so far have been Spain
where I did the Camino de Santiago, and the Annapurna Circuit in
Nepal, a place where I almost didn't make it.

### Off-Trail Life

In my free time I like to take long walks along the lakefront trails
in Chicago, as cliché as that may sound, and read a good fiction book.
I also enjoy playing the entire Halo series (it's my favorite) on
XBOX, and you can find me online at "Eyez Akimbo".
