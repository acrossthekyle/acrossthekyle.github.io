What a place to wake up in. The sun was shining bright, the sky was full of
pink-white clouds, and the tall grasses around me were bright and golden as I
exited from my tent. The others were already awake and/or slowly rising as well,
which meant it was time to make some oatmeal for breakfast, and start packing up.

It felt like we walked through those golden-bright fields of grain forever this
morning. It sure was a sight to behold. But all good things must come to an end,
and we started to hike up and up until we were overlooking a large lake below.
The wind had also picked up at the top of the hill we had just climbed and was
blowing everyones hair all over the place. Ugh, but who could complain; these
views!

On the other side of the hill the wind was less intense as we walked through
woods made of short round pine trees, and some others that had been through a
forest fire in years passed. A large tourquise river flowed nearby, but luckily
we didn't have to worry about crossing it, or walking alongside it. There was a
checkpoint in the woods that the trail went by where we had to get our permits
checked, in order to ensure we were authorized to be there. No issues, and on
we went.

Pine trees gave way to yellow grains which gave way to dark green flora. We could
also see snow-capped mountains in the distance, as we steadily walked in their
direction. We came upon some marshy lands, and thankfully there was a well-
maintained boardwalk going through them. If that wasn't there, this would have
been a very different kind of day.

After about 30 minutes we left the marshes behind and we greeted with our first
sights of Dickson, our refugio for the night. It sat on the shores of a large
lake, encircled by trees and had a large field where we could pitch our tents if
we wanted to, however; nature is a fast teacher. Given the experience we all had
last night from the wind, we all choose spots near the treeline, or behind tall
bushes, so that we would be protected from any future gale-force winds.

The refugio had a full indoor kitchen within which to cook our meals, as well as
hot showers and full bathrooms. The best feature about this place though, was
the shoreline and rocky beach behind it. I walked up and down it, snapping photos
of the monsterous mountains that lined the shores on the other side from us,
and some of them were actually in Argentina, that's how close to the border we
were!
