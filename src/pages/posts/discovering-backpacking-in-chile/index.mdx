In the spring of 2016 I went to Chile in South
America in order to go the Lollapalooza music festival
in Santiago, and to visit the southern region known as Patagonia. The previous
year I had taken my first-ever international trip to Buenos
Aires, Argentina and I had fallen in love with the region. The culture,
people, and climate, were very different from what I was used to in Chicago
and I felt right at home. The cities themselves are a joy to walk around and
explore: I highly recommend the hop-on-hop-off style of tour buses that travel
around the cities.

While in Buenos Aires I went to Lollapalooza as well, and also took a short
flight over to Uruguay to visit the beaches and explore for a couple of days.
The weather did not cooperate though so I was limited to exploring the area
around the hotel, but this was fine since these cities are designed with
pedestrians in mind: they have dedicated plazas and whole avenues where cars
are not allowed and you can walk along the streets window shopping with ease.

Santiago was a bit different than Buenos Aires. It felt more walk-able, and
it wasn't flat like Buenos Aires was. Here in Santiago they had a handful of
large hills directly in the middle of the city which provided great day hikes
up to see the city from on high.

After doing some sight-seeing in the city for a couple of days, I went on a
guided day-hike up to a glacier up in the Andes mountains just outside of
Santiago. It was a group hike, and luckily some of the members had to cancel
which made it a much more casual group. There was myself, an old married
couple from the Netherlands, and the two guides who hiked us up to the
glacier.

This was my first time doing an actual hike/trek in mountains. And in case you
didn't know, Chicago (and most of Illinois) is very, very, flat. So, the only
walking/hiking in nature that I had done up to that point was through flat
terrain, and over very small hills. The day-hikes up the hills in Santiago
prepared me for this hike to the glacier, and luckily the trail wasn't too
steep.

Along the way I got to see my first pre-historic fossils! They were in the
rocks and appeared to be pre-cambrian sea life. I was in awe since I had
never seen anything like this before. We also got the chance to drink some of
the fresh glacier water melt that was trickly down a mountain stream. It was
probably the coldest, and freshest, water I had ever had up until that point.

As we got higher and higher I had to take more and more breaks to catch my
breath; this was my first time being up at a high elevation after
all. Finally, after a small false summit, our lead guide turned around,
offered his hand to help me up and said "congrats, you made it".

There, in cold silence, stood the leading edge of the glacier as it melted and
crumbled into a small mountain lake.

Of all the firsts on this trip, this was one of the best.

Having never seen a glacier before (except in books and movies of course) I
was floored. It was so quiet up there, I could hear the glacier moving! We
unpacked our lunches they had bought for us and each choose a rock to
sit on as we ate and starred across the brown waters of the lake at this
marvel of nature.

The lead guide had brought a flute with them, and offered to play a song for
us while we sat/lay there. It was a truly serene experience, being in such a
cold and quiet place, surrounded by mountains, listening to the glacier move,
and having the relaxing sounds of a wind flute being played.

What a truly magical experience.

The next day was the start of the weekend, and that meant Lollapalooza. I
enjoyed myself at the music festival, and got to see a lot of familar names,
including Eminem! This festival, and the one in Buenos Aires, were really well
organized, and did not feel crowded at all. Lollapalooza is also held in
Chicago every year, and I've never been to it there due to how crowded it
gets.

After two days of the music festival I was ready for a change-up. It was time
to embark on the next portion of this vacation and that was Patagonia.

Here I was, at the bottom of the world (from my point of view in Chicago at
least). I rented a car and drove on the Ruta del Fin del Mundo (End of the
World Route) towards my homebase for the next few days: Puerto Natales. From
here I went on a boat tour of the area and saw some more glaciers close-
up, and then visited Torres del Paine national park.

If I had to choose a moment in my life that got me interested in backpacking
(mind you it wouldn't be until 2018 that I actually took the leap and did it),
it would be this place. I did another guided day-hike (which I later realized
could have been a self-guided day-hike) in the national park and we went up
to Refuge Chileno and then on to the Towers themselves. What a sight to
behold! I was fully hooked on being in the mountains.

I was soo fascinated by those who were doing a backpacking trek in the area,
and staying at the Refuge. The idea of this lifestyle would grab hold of me
and eventually make me do the Camino de Santiago in Spain two years later. And
then nearly four years later from this day I would return to Patagonia to do
the ["O" Circuit thru-hike](10) in this national park.

Chile, and South America as a whole, left a mark on me and planted the seed of
an idea that would eventually culminate in me being an international travler,
and thru-hiker.
