In the vibrant spring of 2016, I embarked on an exhilarating adventure to Chile, South America, where I dove headfirst into the electrifying atmosphere of the Lollapalooza music festival in Santiago and ventured into the breathtaking wilderness of Patagonia! Just a year prior, I had taken my very first international journey to Buenos Aires, Argentina, and I was completely captivated by the region. The dynamic culture, warm people, and unique climate swept me off my feet, making me feel instantly at home. The cities themselves are a delight to explore on foot—if you ever go, don’t miss the hop-on-hop-off buses that take you on a spirited tour around the sights!

During my time in Buenos Aires, I experienced the thrill of Lollapalooza and took a short flight to Uruguay for a little beach fun. Unfortunately, the weather didn’t quite cooperate, limiting my exploration to the charming streets around my hotel. But it was no issue! These pedestrian-friendly cities are filled with welcoming plazas and broad avenues where cars are off-limits, allowing for leisurely strolls filled with window shopping and vibrant street life.

Santiago, however, was a whole different ball game. It felt more alive and walkable, with plenty of rolling hills that beckoned me to explore. In the heart of the city, massive hills provided an incredible backdrop and inviting day hikes that offered stunning panoramic views of the urban landscape below.

After soaking in the city sights for a couple of days, I geared up for a thrilling guided day hike to a glacier high up in the majestic Andes mountains just outside of Santiago. To my luck, a few members of the hiking group had cancelled, resulting in a laid-back excursion with just me, an adventurous elderly couple from the Netherlands, and two enthusiastic guides leading the charge.

This was my debut into serious hiking, and let me tell you—coming from flat Chicago, where the landscape is more pancake than peak, this was a total game changer! While the trail had a few steep sections, my prior hikes up the city hills prepared me for the ascent.

As we climbed, I marveled at my very first encounter with prehistoric fossils embedded in the rocks—traces of ancient sea life from the pre-Cambrian era! I was completely awestruck. To top it off, we quenched our thirst with ice-cold glacier melt water from a nearby mountain stream—it was the most refreshing sip I’d ever experienced!

As we gained elevation, I found myself needing more breaks to catch my breath—this was my first adventure at high altitude, after all! But finally, after navigating past a small false summit, our lead guide enthusiastically extended his hand and exclaimed, “Congrats, you made it!”

And there it was, the stunning glacier, melting serenely into a picturesque mountain lake, enveloped in an atmosphere of pure tranquility.

I had never laid eyes on a glacier outside of books and films, and the reality left me utterly speechless. The silence up there was almost magical; the only sound was the gentle movement of the glacier itself! We settled onto rocks, unwrapped our lunches, and gazed in wonder at the glacier while enjoying our food with a view.

As if it couldn’t get any better, our lead guide surprised us by playing a soothing tune on a flute—it was a beautifully serene moment, surrounded by spectacular mountains, listening to the glacier’s whispers and the soft melody wafting through the air.

What an unforgettable experience!

The next day, the weekend kicked off with the highlight of my musical journey: Lollapalooza! I reveled in the energy of the festival, catching electrifying performances from familiar artists, including none other than Eminem! This festival, like the one in Buenos Aires, was impressively organized—never once did I feel overcrowded. It was a welcome contrast to the chaotic Lollapalooza held in Chicago, which I’ve always avoided due to the crowds.

After two exhilarating days of music, I was eager for a new adventure: it was time to set my sights on Patagonia!

Imagine this moment: I was at the very bottom of the world (at least from my perspective in Chicago)! I rented a car and hit the road along the breathtaking Ruta del Fin del Mundo (End of the World Route) towards my home base in Puerto Natales. From there, I embarked on a stunning boat tour, getting up close and personal with even more magnificent glaciers, and later set out to explore the spectacular Torres del Paine National Park.

If I had to pinpoint the exact moment that sparked my passion for backpacking (a journey that would ultimately lead me to the Camino de Santiago in Spain two years later), this place was it! I joined another guided day-hike that took us to the legendary Refuge Chileno and onward to see the iconic Towers up close—what an awe-inspiring sight! The experience ignited a fire within me for mountain adventures.

I was entranced by the backpackers trekking through the region, staying at the Refuge, leading me to dream of a lifestyle that revolved around exploration and nature. This trip changed my life forever, and its influence still resonates with me to this day!
