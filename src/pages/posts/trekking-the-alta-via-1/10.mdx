Last day on trail. It would be a lot of going downhill today. We got an early
start in order to make sure we had plenty of time to catch that bus, otherwise
we would have to figure out another way of getting into town. There was another
cable car for re-supply at this rifugio, and I thought about taking it down
instead of walking.

Most of the first part of the morning was spent going laterally instead of
vertically. There was an initial descent from the rifugio but then it became a
straight shot acoss the mountains before we started going down. I turned back
for one last look and the whole area looked like something out of an idyllic
dream.

I was on the hunt for the Edelweiss flower as someone last night had told us
this was a good area to spot some. Alas, I did not spot any today. We travelled
over trails cut into the side of moss and grass-covered mountains. Clouds
started to roll in shortly thereafter. It further increased the dream-like
quality of the day.

Forests started to dominate our view as we left the scraggly tree-less upper
elevations behind and descended down steep zig-zagging switchbacks. We were
going different speeds so we all spread out and got separated. But about
halfway down there was a rifugio that had an open kitchen and, most importantly,
bathrooms. We ate last nights pie leftovers as a snack. Beforelong we were ready
to keep going.

As we went down the sides of the mountains, and the valley we were going down,
steepened which allowed for views up and down it's entire width. It was cool to
be able to see where we had come from all the way up yonder.

On the way I spoke with some other hikers who had the GR20 (Grande Randonnee 20)
in Corsica, France and I asked if I was someone who could do it, given that I had
read it was the hardest hike in Europe. They said "Yes, of course! If you can do
this hike then you can do that one, it's no different." This made me feel more
confident about doing it, but sadly it would still be nearly 5 years before I
decided to conquer it.

We finished the thru-hike around 11 am. It was an unceremonious ending,
it was just a bus stop on a road somewhere after all. But behind the bus stop
area was a very wide river with a rocky beach, and we took the opportunity to
ditch our backpacks and stick our feet in the cold water. Each one of us nearly
slipped into the cold water as we tried to venture our into the flowing waters.

Eventually it was time to regroup, re-shoe, pack up, and head back up to the
road as the bus was due to arrive soon. By that time more people had arrived,
and it was a full bus ride back into civilization.

I really liked this one. It had great food, amazing views, an easy trail,
and great people with which to enjoy it all. Maybe in the future I'll return
and try the Alta Via 2!
