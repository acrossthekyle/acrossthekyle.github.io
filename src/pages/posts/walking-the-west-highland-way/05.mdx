Today would be filled with a mixture of sun and rain, and mountains, while
traveling through the true highlands of Scotland. I had a cabin reserved for
the night in the town of Kinlochleven, and would desperately need it after
another rain-soaked day.

A rivers rushing waters, a kind of whitenoise, always help me sleep. Breakfast
today would be two packets of granola and two packets of dried banana slices. I
had a surplus of backpacking food at this point, and would be able to leave the
rest of it behind at the cabin tonight since tomorrow would be my last day on
trail. The clock struck 8am, and I was on my way.

Forests lined the riverbank where I slept last night, and it was nice to be
walking within them right out of the gate. Rains last night created fresh wet
conditions on the trail though, which meant more tiptoeing on any rocks that
stuck their tops above water. My shoes did stay dry for long sadly.

Not 30 minutes later and forests were already behind me, and scraggly grasslands
lay before me, with a large lake in the distance. Up and over hills, dry patches
of trail few and far between. Discontinous forests in oddly arranged groups
were in the distance all around me, perhaps a reforesting process? Up ahead
there was a bed and breakfast, but the restaurant services were only for guests
and the store for buying snacks wasn't open yet. I waited a little bit to see
if someone would come and open up shop, but they never did. Given how far I
would have to go today I decided to simply bust out a protein bar and keep going.

The terrain today varied between forests, and grasslands, and the trail
seemed to stretch on forever into the distant mountains. By this point, around
10am, the clouds started to drop their rain on me. It started as a fine mist,
but slowly turned into a steady downpour of rain. I did not see many people on
today's segment, maybe the rain kept them away.

Besides the rain, the views on this part of the trail today were amazing! I
love hiking in the mountains, and today I was surrounded by all sorts of them.
I truly felt like I was alone in the world today, walking through this remote
land, with the unrelenting rain beating down on me, and not another soul in
sight.

For nearly two hours I marched on through the rain, up and over small passes
between mountains, trying to stay in good spirits. Eventually the trail left
the remote world behind and joined up with a paved road that led to a hotel
called The Kingshouse. It's one of the stops along the way, and I hoped they
would have hot food, and sure enough, they did.

I spent a good long hour there, eating hot food, and trying to let my stuff dry
out as much as possible. I used one of the bathroom stales to change out of my
wet clothing, and into some fresh dry things. There's nothing like a dry pair of
socks and underwear to immediately brighten ones spirits. At 1pm I left The
Kingshouse behind and continued on me way, through more mountains.

The rain was done for the day, thank god, and the sunshine brought the most
amazing views I had seen so far. A bright blue sky, and dark stone mountains,
dominated my view, and the world around me. These pictures don't do it justice.

After walking through these amazing mountains for another 90 minutes, it was time
to start descending down into the town of Kinlochleven. It was a long way down,
took nearly an hour but felt like forever what with all of the twist and turns
in the trail. Eventually I reached the towns outer limits, and it wasn't a
pleasant way to enter the town: the trail exits right next to a factory.

There were also no waymarks as I got into town telling me which way the trail
would go tomorrow, so I had to pop open Google Maps and figure out how to
actually get into the town. After a wrong turn I made it to the town center.
Finding the cabin took a bit more effort, and figuring out where to go in was
also tricky, I even had to call the host in order to figure out where to go.

I settled in and began laying out my cold wet gear in order for it to try out.
The place had a TV, which was nice, and the bed was big and comfy. I made the
last of my backpacking meals for dinner, and discarded the rest. I was looking
forward to a good nights sleep.
