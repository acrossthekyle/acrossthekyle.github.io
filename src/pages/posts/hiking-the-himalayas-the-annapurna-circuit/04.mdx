We're starting to get our first looks at snow-covered mountains! Another
suspension bridge took us out of town and into thick forests made up of a
mix of conifer and deciduous trees. An arch over the trail thanked us for
visiting.

The trail was also becoming more congested with hikers, seeing as some choose
to take a jeep past the first few places and skip ahead. We feel like we're
true hikers who are doing the whole thing from beginning to end.

At the next village we came across prayer drums that spin in a row and you're
meant to spin them clockwise in order to get good luck for trekking in the
mountains. We're going to make sure we do this every chance we get!

Another big waterfall crossing today, luckily only one hat was lost in this one.
Most of the day after that was spent walking through woods with leaves of
various colors, with long suspension bridge crossings scattered here and there.

In the distance we could start to see snow-capped peaks. Six hours later and we
came to Chame.
