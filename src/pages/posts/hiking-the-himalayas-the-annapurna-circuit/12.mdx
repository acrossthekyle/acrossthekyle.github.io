The two remaining members of our group, Veronique and myself, set out from
Marpha bound for Ghasa. It would be a mostly dusty trail today, and on part
of the way we had a dog follow us for some time, hoping for food most likely.

We walked over bridges, through bright green grassy fields and forests, and
over many river crossings. Lots of jeeps on todays trail as well. Sadly I lost
one of my flipflops on the way today, not sure where. We also passed through
some apple orchards.

Most of the trail was along the road, and there were some places to stop along
the way, but most of them were empty and/or run-down. Not much food offerings
either.

More walking along riverbeds as well today. We didn't see any other hikers
until we entered the village of Ghasa, and even then it was few and far between.
It was feeling very lonely on trail. We found a place to stay and the rooms
weren't that bad. We each had our own which was nice though, usually not a
common thing on the Annapurna Circuit.
