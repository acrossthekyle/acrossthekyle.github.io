Today we would be heading back towards Manang, and then taking a sharp left
away from the valley that Manang resided in as we would be turning torwards
Thorong La Pass, and the climax of our trek together.

We left Shree Kharka and bid farewell to the sand-colored valley walls. Small
scraggly bushes now dominated the landscape around us as we retraced our steps.
At an outlook point overlooking Manang we stopped and posed for pictures, saying
goodbye to the first half of this circuit, and then turned to the left and
continued our hike upwards and onto another valley.

Upon entering this new valley we could see the entire trail laid out before us,
twisting and bending and winding its way over the terrain. On we marched, heads
down, focused on closing the distance between us and our place for the night at
Thoron Phedi. We stopped for lunch at a place that had teepees available for
sleeping in, and enjoyed some food and sodas.

It was still going to take us another 3-4 hours before we would be able to see
the refuge for the night. Up and down the rocks we went, over rivers, through
small thinly wooded forests, climbing ever higher. Today we would technically
be losing more elevation than we would be gaining, but it was still a challenge
to gain any altitude.

At long last we arrived, nearly 7 hours after starting the days hike. These were
some of the hardest mattresses I have ever slept on, but this place had
__*the best*__ veggie burger that I have ever had. Tomorrow wouldn't
be as early of a day as yesterday was, so we had a chance to catch up on some
sleep before making the pass.
