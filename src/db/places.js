          "After breaking camp our group drove to the start of the trail. I stepped onto the backpacking trail from Brown's Hollow Trailhead in the crisp morning air, eager to explore this corner of Iowa and get back into local overnight backpacking. The trail started out gently enough. A wide, packed earth path winding through towering hardwood forests with leaves ablaze in fiery reds and golds.",
          "Our destination for the night was Browns Hollow, a backpacking campsite about three quarters of a mile off of the main trail.",
          "A few moments later after crossing the road (we were going counter-clockwise instead of clockwise), the views really opened up and we got a glimpse of the hills in the distance, with a river forking in front of it and flowing beneath our feet. Sunlight dappled through the canopy, highlighting ferns and mosses clinging to rocks.",
          "The path abruptly ended at earthen stairs indicating the base of the first of three hills. Muddy and steep, the path narrowed and snaked its way up the hill, becoming a more defined singletrack, dipping and climbing. Once at the top we had commanding views of the surrounding area, and could even spot our campground from the previous night below.",
          "This was how the rest of the trail went, up and down up and down. We summited two more big hills, each as steep as the first. After coming down from the last hill we were assaulted by clouds of lady bugs, and we didn't waste any time in moving on. The trail leveled out, following the snaking river.",
          "Reaching the campsite at Brown's Hollow felt like a reward. A peaceful clearing with well-maintained grounds. Water was not as abundant as we thought it would be, and we had to make due with a small muddy pool (which our water filters were able to handle without issue).",
          "We enjoyed a campfire from dried bark and branches both big and small. Luckily the fire ring was massive and could accomodate branches of various sizes. With temps dropping we retired to our tents.\n"
        ],
        "excerpt": "Our group wound its way through hardwood forests and tackled steep, muddy climbs for views of the Iowa landscape. After navigating varied terrain, including several hills and areas with ladybug swarms, we reached our campsite for the night.",

          "I would have enjoyed a warm and restful night of sleep, if it hadn't been for whatever creature attempted to push its way underneath my sleeping pad from the outside of the tent. Not sure if it was a snake, or some sort of burrowing animal, but it was pushing hard. So much so that I could feel it through the air mattress. I pushed down through the air pad and whatever it was retreated. Needless to say, I didn't sleep much after that.",
          "Once others had woken up I asked one of them to help me kick out whatever might be under there, but when we lifted up my tent whatever it was had left long ago.",
          "After a warm filling breakfast (double serving of a backpacking meal), we set out for the final two hours of trail. A common phrase in backpacking is 'be bold, start cold', and I did just that: with only my baselayers on we started hiking.",
          "More rolling hills filled with golden leaves surrounded us as we marched on over slightly hilly terrain with one medium-sized hill on our way that required a mere 300 feet of elevation gain. A short detour to a fire tower/observation platform was a bust: it was locked up tight.",

          "We woke from a less-than-stellar night of sleep, ready to take on the day after a breakfast of cereal with warm milk, scrambled eggs, bread with Nutella, and coffee (which somehow still didn't feel like enough).",
          "The hike began with a brutal three miles of steep uphill. We were panting with every step until a brief rest where a kind Frenchman checked on us: \"Se va? You ok?\". After that initial ascent, the trail flattened a bit through the woods, leading down to a picturesque suspension bridge before climbing up again. The scenery was lovely, definitely channeling the spirit of \"Climb every mountain\".",
          "Then came the main event: the Col de Tricot. Hours of relentless uphill with zero shade had us working overtime all over again. The wind at the top was a relief though, perfect for a much-needed lunch. The packed sandwich from the gite was brie, tomato, and lettuce on a baguette. It was lifesaving, even if the accompanying orange was a messy affair.",
          "The descent was another challenge: 1 hour and 10 minutes of switchbacks that tormented our toes. We hit Miage at the bottom and we wished we were staying there. A short rest and water break, then another 35 minutes up to our night's lodging, Auberge le Truc.",
          "Auberge le Truc is rustic. Limited water, no showers, and a very interesting (broken) conveyor belt pit toilet. The simple pleasure of the constant, rhythmic sound of cowbells made up for the lack of amenities.",
          "Dinner with three Brits was an experience. The meal started strong with a great vegetable soup, followed by a funky but good combination of pasta with red sauce, a cheese omelette, cheese slices, and crème brûlée.",
          "Tonight's accomodation is a 28-person bunk bed room. We've snagged the top bunks by the door and are all packed and ready for an early departure tomorrow morning. Another day, another adventure down!\n"
        ],
        "excerpt": "From punishing uphill miles to a rustic auberge filled with cowbells and camaraderie, this was a day that tested, and rewarded, us in equal measure.",

          "The day began early with a 6:30 AM wake-up. Thanks to last night's strategic packing, we managed a silent, lightning-fast exit from the 28-person bunk room. Fuel was simple but essential: coffee and bread with butter and jam.",
          "The first hour was a lovely descent through the woods towards Les Contamines-Montjoie. Our smooth exit was briefly interrupted by a worker from the place we had stayed at. Turns out we'd forgotten to pay! Debt settled, we arrived in town just as a 'Fête Village' farmers market was coming to life. It was absolutely adorable. We stocked up on protein bars at the market, though we had to skip the pharmacy for extra sunscreen as it wasn't opening until 10:00 AM.",
          "Leaving town, the trail followed a flat, pleasant stretch along the river, passing 'family fun' zones for golf, tennis, and soccer. Then, the real work began.",
          "The climb was steep, though thankfully not quite as brutal as day one, winding through more beautiful woods. Eventually, we reached the long, shadeless ascent to the Col du Bonhomme. The lack of cover was tough, but the gorgeous wildflowers and a quick chat with an older couple from Buffalo kept our spirits up.",
          "We finally reached the Refuge de la Croix du Bonhomme. This massive stone structure can house over 100 people, but we're tucked into a cozy room for six.",
          "The post-hike routine was a whirlwind: all of it is currently hanging out to dry. A single coin buys four minutes of warm water. We let the mountain breeze dry our hair while enjoying some cold blonde beers and reading.",
          "Dinner was a lively, international affair. We sat with six Israelis, enjoying a vegetable dinner of pepper pizza, carrot and beet salad, and soup. Half the table was vegetarian for Kosher reasons, and the sun blazed on our backs and necks as we ate, still sweating from the day's effort.",
          "The evening ended with a long political and travel chat outside until the mountain air turned too cold. We headed to bed, surrounded by the damp smell of laundry drying on the bunks. Ready to do it all again tomorrow!\n"

          "The trail didn't make it easy as we began our ascent toward the peak. We had to navigate snow bridges, and at one point, my foot actually fell through the crust. With a mule trailing behind us and the surreal sound of someone singing \"Edelweiss\" in the distance, we kept moving.",
          "We finally hit the valley floor, stopped for a quick bathroom break at the Glacier Villa, and made the 30-minute trek to Refuge des Mottets for lunch. I treated myself to a nutella crepe while my partner stuck to bread, cheese, an apple, and banana chips.",
          "The afternoon was a long, lonely slog. The road started as a soft slope where we were the only people in sight, but it ended in a brutal, steep scramble over loose rocks and slippery snow. The trail became nearly impossible to find, and by the time we reached our refuge, we were exhausted.",
          "We were the first to arrive at our stop (an 11-person refuge). Our room has eight people, and the beds are so close we're basically sharing with strangers. Almost everyone here speaks exclusively French, which made the difficult day feel even more isolating.",
          "After helping a fellow American named Andrew (who was awkwardly stuck without cash) and discussing the snowy shortcut for tomorrow, we made a tough call. Because of the conditions, we're waking up early to go back down the way we came. It adds three hours to the journey, but safety comes first.",
          "Dinner was a lesson in local custom: a thin vegetable soup with bread and cheese (the French hikers insisted the cheese goes in the soup), followed by rice, lentils, and poppyseed cake.",
          "Today was a reminder that the mountain always has the final say.\n"
        ],
        "excerpt": "Today was a rough one, with slippery snow bridges, and loose rocks. By the time we reached Refuge des Mottets, exhaustion set in, and we still had to go back up the mountain-side.",

          "Today was the definitive 'hardest day' of the trek so far: 15+ miles and two massive ascents. It started early, with a 5:45 AM wake-up in our cramped quarters. We carried our baskets of gear (couldn't bring our backpacks inside the refuge) to the dining tables to get dressed. Breakfast was minimal, just a little coffee, so we grabbed some bread for the road, left a note for Andrew, and set off.",
          "Descent #1: The Video Game Levels",
          "The first descent felt like navigating levels in a video game. We even named the sections: Find the Trail / Snow Bridges, The Balance Beam, Vertical Descent, Sloping Descent, Mini Switchbacks, Wide Switchbacks (Where we had to take a massive detour around some stubborn cows), The Road, and finally The Wide(r) Road.",
          "We moved fast, though the first three 'levels' were genuinely scary. We made it to Refuge des Mottets by 8:30 AM for a second 'breakfast' of hard-boiled eggs and bread just as the other hikers were heading out for their day.",

          "Next was the climb up to the Col de la Seigne. It started with steep switchbacks before turning into a long, slow, almost monotonous straight ascent. But the reward at the top was worth it: a stunning view of Mont Blanc and the realization that we were officially in Italy!",
          "Descent #2: The Valley and the 'Desert'",
          "The descent into the Italian side led us through a low valley filled with puddles and mountain bikers. We stopped for lunch at Rifugio Elisabetta, where we had a surprisingly good burrito packed with carrots, apples, and nuts from the refuge last night. The trek continued down a dead-straight road that felt like walking through a desert, despite the lush plants, and the heat was relentless.",

          "As a storm rolled in, we did a massive amount of laundry, leaving it out until the very first raindrop fell. We then transformed our bunk room into a drying rack, using an ingenious system of string and trekking poles to hang everything.",
          "Dinner was a social and culinary mix. We sat with a non-English speaking couple and John, a New Yorker living in Vienna. The menu was delicious: pasta with red sauce and Parmesan, followed by peas, carrots, and cheese, and almond cake for dessert. The food was excellent.",

By the time we reached Rifugio Maison Vieille in Italy, we were completely spent but relieved, refreshed by a proper shower, warm food, and the satisfaction of surviving the day.",

          "After the grueling mileage of yesterday, we allowed ourselves a 'late' start. We spent the morning wrestling with our mountain of laundry and enjoying a breakfast of bread with berry jam, fruit cocktail, individual yogurt jars, and much-needed coffee.",
          "The journey began with a descent into the town of Courmayeur. While the three Brits we'd met earlier opted for the chairlift, we committed to the trail. It was a forest trek filled with endless switchbacks.",
          "Courmayeur is absolutely stunning; all stone sidewalks and narrow, charming streets (though I've learned that Italians do not move out of the way for hikers!). We ran errands like pros: hit the pharmacy for sunscreen, the grocery store for protein bars, and a local panetteria for lunch. We grabbed mushroom focaccia and a classic cheese pizza; it was easily the best food of the trip so far.",
          "The ascent out of town was a series of forest switchbacks where we played a high-stakes game of 'cat and mouse' with several other couples. Proud to say: we won.",
          "We reached the Rifugio Bertone just as the clouds broke. We huddled under an awning for the heavy stuff and deployed our rainflies for the first time as we hiked out in the drizzle. We found a spot on a cliff just above the refuge to enjoy a simple lunch of bread and cheese.",
          "What followed was the absolute best walk of the trip. A long, flat stretch of trail with views that made every uphill battle worth it.",
          "We eventually rolled into Rifugio Bonatti. The rooms here are giant; there are 10 of us in ours, with five beds lined up in a row. We're crossing our fingers no one ends up in the gap between us and the couple next door! The showers were ice cold even though they promised two minutes of warmth that never materialized, and we set up another ingenious laundry stringing system across a wooden wardrobe.",
          "Before dinner, we decompressed with some reading, beer, and spicy cheese balls. Dinner was a lively table of nine: us, three Swiss school friends, and a French family of four. We feasted on bread, salad, farfalle in red sauce, steamed veggies with a veggie burger, and chocolate pudding. The entertainment of the night was watching the adjacent table rinse their meat in their water glasses before eating. We couldn't tell if it was too salty or a cultural habit, but it certainly gave us something to talk about!",
          "Now, it's time for podcasts in bed as we rest up for whatever tomorrow brings. Moving through Italy is proving to be a beautiful, blistered, and delicious adventure.\n"

          "We woke up with the sun this morning and headed down to a buffet-style breakfast, a welcome change! We fueled up on yogurt with granola, fruit cocktail, and the classic trail staple of bread and butter.",
          "Today was easily the best hike of the trip so far. It felt almost like a rest day compared to the previous climbs. We started with a gorgeous flat stretch along a ridge before descending toward a river.",
          "The climb up to Grand Col Ferret was a long, slow incline. It was a bit drizzly, but we felt strong and actually clocked our best ascent time yet! Reaching the top meant crossing the border into Switzerland. It was absolutely freezing at the summit, so we had a very quick lunch by a giant wooden cross before starting the descent.",
          "The way down was gentle, passing through flocks of sheep. Halfway down, we stopped at a charming refuge with woodchip floors, where we had a wonderful surprise: we ran into Angel and Milene from our very first night in Les Houches! It was so good to see familiar faces. We shared some apple and chocolate before continuing the trek along a pretty river road.",
          "We finally arrived in the town of La Fouly and checked into the Hotel Edelweiss. It's a fancy hotel, but we're tucked away in the attic dorms. The perks? A hot shower with amazing water pressure. We've officially mastered the 'plastic bag laundry system' and hung our clothes outside under the protection of the balconies.",
          "We're sharing a room with Mackenzie from Albany and Kaitlyn from Virginia. We spent the afternoon running to the grocery store for a power adapter (no luck), but we did score cheese crackers and jalapeño chips. We retreated to the hotel to watch a massive downpour from the window, sipping rosé and reading.",
          "Dinner was a social rollercoaster. We sat with some new folks named Faith, Rob, and Antoine. Some of them were a lot with nonstop talking. On the other hand, Antoine was fascinating: a Brazilian MMA fighter and boat captain!",
          "The food was fantastic: vegetable soup, tofu with veggies and rice, and ice cream pie (hands down the best dessert of the trip).",
          "The night ended with us moving our damp laundry to the cubby strings in the room and sharing a few laughs with our roommates before bed. Switzerland is off to a great start!\n"

          "We started the morning with another great Swiss buffet: cappuccinos, strawberry yogurt with fruit, and fresh bread buns with butter and jam.",
          "Today was billed as a 'rest day', but the trail had other ideas. The morning began with a beautiful, flat stretch along a river and through dense woods. With the mossy rocks and towering pines, it felt exactly like the Pacific Northwest. We passed through a charming old Swiss village (possibly L'A Neuve or Issert) filled with traditional wooden houses that looked like they belonged in a storybook.",
          "While our roommates Mackenzie and Caitlyn decided to take the bus because they heard this section was 'boring', we stuck to the path. After the flat start, the trail began to climb. Honestly, it was exhausting.",
          "We stopped for lunch at a wooden table in the forest and enjoyed a total feast: two sandwiches each made with fresh bread, cheese, lettuce, and thin carrot slices. They were incredible!",
          "The final push was tough. Our legs felt it, likely because we ate a bit too much at lunch! We took a brief wrong turn but quickly corrected course while chatting with a British family who had made the same mistake.",
          "We finally reached Champex-Lac, a stunning lakeside town. We had planned to soak our feet in the lake, but as the clouds began to roll in, we ducked into a restaurant just in time to beat the downpour. We spent the afternoon sipping rosé and watching Olympic fencing on the TV.",
          "Once the sky cleared, we walked to Gîte Bon Abri. We arrived at 2:30 PM, but since it didn't open until 4:00 PM, we spent the afternoon sitting in the sun trying to 'fix' our hiker tan lines. My phone automatically remembered the Wi-Fi password from when I stayed here six years ago, saving most of the people waiting from boredom.",
          "By a stroke of luck, we ended up with a private room. Since the rain returned, we immediately turned it into a drying room, stringing laundry everywhere. After showering we settled in to read until dinner.",
          "Dinner was a cozy affair at a circular table with a group of French speakers. The menu was quintessential Switzerland: thin vegetable soup, lettuce and carrot salad, cheese fondue with plenty of bread and potatoes, and cake for dessert.",
          "Despite the 'rest day' lies the trail told us, ending it with fondue and a private room made it all worth it.\n"

          "Today started on a bit of a low note. Breakfast was yogurt with granola, toast, and coffee, and it didn't hit the spot. We took the Bovine trail, and while the climb through the woods was gradual, our legs soon felt the climb.",
          "It was one of those 'cat and mouse' days on the trail, constantly passing and being passed by Mackenzie, Kaitlyn, Angel, and the three British ladies. At one point, the fatigue really hit, but then, the trail provided.",
          "Just before reaching the summit, we hit a refuge famous for its cakes. We staged a long, glorious intervention for our spirits, chatting with the British women over apple crumble, apple quiche, and chocolate. That sugar boost was exactly what we needed for the final push and the subsequent descent. Along the way, we spotted a helicopter hovering nearby; we couldn't tell if it was a rescue mission or just a supply drop, but it's always a sobering reminder of how remote these mountains are.",
          "We rolled into Trient around 1:30 PM, but with check-in not until 3:00 PM, we made ourselves at home in the grass at the camping area. We knocked out the daily chores of bathroom, laundry, and a blissfully hot shower, and spent the afternoon listening to podcasts while our clothes dried in the sun.",
          "Our accommodation tonight is a 12-person dorm, and we were the first ones to claim our spots. After a little more socializing with Angel and Milene at the restaurant, we retreated to our beds for a pre-dinner recharge.",
          "Dinner was a bit of a quiet affair. We were at a table for eight, but only six of us showed up. Our companions included two Germans who didn't say much beyond 'hello', an older Frenchman with zero English, and a younger French runner who was tackling the trail in the opposite direction. He was friendly and chatted as best he could!",
          "The meal was solid: a very good, thick squash soup, a cheese omelette with veggies and fries, and lemon vanilla ice cream for dessert.",
          "Now, it's back to the dorm to rest up. Tomorrow, we keep moving!\n"
        ],
        "excerpt": "A gradual climb along the Bovine trail turned into a day of ups and downs, boosted by a much-needed sugar stop with apple crumble and chocolate near a summit. We ended in Trient with a quiet dinner, resting up for the next day on the trail.",

          "We learned a hard lesson today: skipping breakfast is a massive mistake. Even though the initial ascent wasn't incredibly steep or long, we felt it. We managed to choke down some protein bars on the way up, and by the time we reached the top to eat with Angel, we finally started to feel human again.",
          "Lunch was a classic trail smorgasbord: hard-boiled eggs, crackers with Babybel cheese, and a much-needed chocolate bar.",
          "From there, we headed up toward the Aiguilles. This was easily one of the most beautiful sections yet: wildflowers were everywhere, and the trail involved some really fun rock scrambles. At one point, we found a perfect little rock nook to sit in; Mackenzie and Kaitlyn were there to capture the moment!",
          "The descent was long but manageable, featuring more scrambling before dropping into forest switchbacks. We eventually arrived at Refuge de la Boerne, which is officially the weirdest place we've stayed yet. It feels exactly like the inside of an 18th-century sailing ship. Our room features a 'four-stack' of bunk beds. We're sharing the space with three older American men and Moris and Olga from the Netherlands.",
          "Before dinner, we enjoyed a delightful 'happy hour' with Moris, Olga, and James and Adriana (Americans living in England). It is so wonderful to have made actual friends on this journey! We may have enjoyed one too many Aperol Spritzes (the classic Italian drink), but it was the perfect way to toast to the day.",
          "Dinner was a lovely, social affair. We sat with the three British ladies along with three Belgian campers. The conversation was fantastic. We feasted on: lettuce and corn salad with balsamic, unlimited fresh baguettes, rice and lentils, brie and applesauce for dessert (a surprisingly great combo!).",
          "The night wound down with a funny group chat about the wonders of Neosporin with the Brits and Jess's family. It's surprisingly quiet in our rooms, and we're ready for some rest before the final legs of this adventure!\n"
        ],
        "excerpt": "Skipping breakfast made us feel the climb, but the trail soon rewarded us with wildflowers, and a perfect spot to pause and take in the views. The day ended at Refuge de la Boerne with happy hour, shared laughs, and a lively dinner, making it one of the most social and memorable stops yet.",

          "We fueled up early today at 6:30 AM with a surprisingly solid breakfast: corn flakes, a fresh baguette with butter and jam, and even fresh bananas! We sat with Moris and Olga, enjoying the calm before what we knew would be a vertical day.",
          "The Ladders: Not for the Faint of Heart",
          "The ascent began with a brutal challenge: gaining massive elevation over just 4 km. Then, we hit the famous TMB ladders. Poor Adriana had to turn back; the height was just too much for her.",
          "We tucked our trekking poles into our water bottle holders, making us look like we had giant antennae, to keep our hands free for climbing. The wooden slat 'ladders' were definitely the sketchiest part, while the metal ones felt rock-solid. Honestly? It was a blast. We celebrated reaching the top of the ladder section with lunch #1: a well-earned bowl of pasta.",
          "The climb continued toward Lac Blanc. The first lake we passed was beautiful but swarming with gnats. We pushed on to the second lake, which was a stunning, crystal-clear blue. This is clearly a popular spot, it was the most crowded we've seen on the trail yet.",
          "We found the perfect rock to sit on and took the plunge, well, a 10-second toe dip into the glacial water. It was freezing and perfect. For lunch #2 we headed up to the refuge for a coke, a cheese omelette, a salted tomato, and a chocolate crepe. Absolute chef's kiss.",
          "The hike down was a bit of a headache. The trail was packed with day-trippers and kids walking three across. We ended up 'off-roading' to get around the crowds, speed-hiking down with a fast-moving couple from DC.",
          "We finally reached Refuge de la Flégère. It's a great spot with a massive dining area and a dorm that sleeps about 24. After the usual routine of shower and laundry, and some reading, we grabbed beers on the patio.",
          "The highlight of the evening was a rowdy game of 'Asshole' (a card game) with the English family. There was plenty of wine and non-stop laughter; they are just the sweetest people.",
          "Dinner was equally great: carrot and cabbage salad, a delicious cheesy potato dish, and chocolate mousse for dessert. My partner was teased by the whole table for hoarding the extra bread, but hey, a hiker's gotta fuel up! Another incredible day in the books. One step closer to the finish!\n"
        ],
        "excerpt": "Today tested us early with steep climbs right out of the gate, the infamous TMB ladders, and breathtaking lakes, including a quick, freezing toe dip in crystal-clear glacial water. We ended at Refuge de la Flégère with beers on the patio, and laughter-filled card games followed by another hearty dinner.",

          "We had breakfast at 7 AM with our trail friends, enjoying great croissants with butter and jam, cereal, and coffee. A perfect start to what was our last 'up' of the entire trip!",
          "The morning's climb was relatively easy, leading us over two peaks to the Col de Brévent. We got stuck behind a slow-moving Spanish family with zero trail awareness, but once we passed them, they were hot on our heels! The final push involved a few ladders and rock scrambles.",
          "The peak was swarmed with tourists who had taken the gondola up, a stark contrast to the quiet trails we're used to.",
          "We began the long descent toward our lunch spot, a refuge about 45 minutes away. We indulged in a delicious lunch: a cheese omelette with diced tomato, bread with butter to make open-faced sandwiches, a final scoop of Nutella (using the last of that extra bread we had hoarded), and a coke.",
          "The descent felt like it went on forever. We realized that 'running' down the mountain was better for our knees than taking heavy, deliberate steps, even if our toes weren't happy about it. We burst out of the woods into Les Houches, completing the circle!",
          "We checked back into the Gîte Michel Fagot, where this all began. We snagged a room for six, immediately utilized the showers and laundry, and finally unpacked our clean clothes from our luggage, a true luxury.",
          "We celebrated with a victory blonde beer at the bar around the corner and even played a game of foosball with a couple from Portland.",
          "Dinner was great. We sat with Mackenzie, Kaitlyn, two Dutch hikers, and one French hiker. The menu included: greek salad with fresh bread, pasta with zucchini and red sauce, and gingerbread milkiness for dessert (very tasty, if a bit runny).",
          "Now, it's time for podcasts and some final rest. We did it. We completed the Tour du Mont Blanc!\n"
        ],
        "excerpt": "The climb over the Col de Brévent and the long descent back to Les Houches marked the last day of our Tour du Mont Blanc, complete with more ladders, rock scrambles, and a well-earned lunch. Back at Gîte Michel Fagot, we celebrated with beers at a nearby bar, foosball at the gîte, and a final dinner after triumphantly completing the entire circuit!",

          "I arrived on the island of Corsica yesterday, ready to start a long-awaited trek. My starting point was Calenzana, where I grabbed a quick dinner with a few other hikers staying at the same gîte. The night that followed was restless, filled with anticipation for the early morning start. I could hardly wait to return to the mountains and immerse myself in the rugged beauty that Corsica promised.",
          "The first day almost had me quitting. The windows had been left open all night to let in a breeze, which helped with the mid-summer heat, but I still didn't sleep well. With little rest, I packed up my gear and had a simple breakfast of yogurt with cereal, a banana, and some bread and butter I had bought the day before. By 6:30 a.m., I was on the trail.",
          "The ascent began immediately, and the trail wasted no time testing me. Although the elevation wasn't extreme, I struggled to catch my breath on the switchbacks. My lack of training beyond walking my dog Dax and an occasional treadmill workout became painfully obvious. My Garmin watch confirmed it: my heart rate stayed firmly in the endurance zone, and I took breaks at every corner just to recover. Despite the challenge, I paused constantly to take photos of the incredible surroundings.",
          "After two and a half hours, I reached a col and enjoyed a stretch of downhill and level trail. The respite was brief, however, as the path soon rose again, this time introducing scrambling and climbing over rocks. I hadn't stretched that morning, and my muscles certainly let me know it. Eventually, the trail opened to a bald section of the mountain, offering a first glimpse of the refuge where I would spend the night. The remaining ups and downs were manageable, and soon I arrived at the refuge and pitched my tent. The site was exposed with no shade or vegetation, a typical setup for this part of the trail.",
          "The refuge was busy, which was exciting because it meant more opportunities to meet fellow hikers. Little lizards scurried about everywhere, and three cows wandered through the camping area, hopefully avoiding my tent. Dinner was a highlight, shared with hikers from Germany, the Netherlands, and Belgium. By the end of the evening, we had formed a small group that would walk and camp together for the next nine days, marking the beginning of an unforgettable adventure.\n"

          "I had thought the second day on the trail would be easier, but Corsica had other plans. Last night was surprisingly quiet for a backpacking campground, and I woke early to take advantage of the comfortable temperatures. I had brought a mini thermometer along to track how well my sleep system performed, and it seemed to be doing its job. I had hoped to catch the sunrise, but it was hidden behind a ridge of mountains, so I quickly packed my gear and prepared for the day with a simple European breakfast of yogurt, bread, and jam.",
          "The trail started with an uphill climb, but I paced myself much better than on the first day and was making steady progress. Soon, the path required more scrambling and climbing, though it felt easier than yesterday's challenges. Despite this, the day remained difficult, with constant ups and downs, the relentless sun beating down in the valleys, and wind beginning to pick up. Certain sections demanded careful boulder-hopping across steep drops, where no chains offered assistance.",
          "The descent from the day's peak proved tricky, with loose rocks making some steep sections feel dangerous. It seemed to last forever, until finally I spotted the refuge as a tiny blue dot in the distance. The trail seemed determined to take its time getting me there, winding around in ways that tested patience as much as stamina.",
          "Once at the refuge, finding a level spot for my tent was a challenge. I ended up using some wooden pallets as a base, weighing things down with rocks to hold the tent in place. It wasn't perfect, but it would have to do, especially with the wind that Corsica seemed ready to unleash later that night.",
          "I spent the evening hanging out with the small group of hikers I had met the previous day. The wind carried the less pleasant smells from the nearby toilets, a small reminder that rustic camping comes with compromises. Despite that, I went to bed early, hoping to recharge for whatever the trail had in store tomorrow.\n"

        "excerpt": "Day two on the Corsica trail proved harder than expected, with loose rocks, scrambling, and unrelenting sun testing my endurance. After a long descent, I finally reached the refuge and set up my tent on makeshift pallets, ready for another night in the mountains.",

          "Rain greeted us overnight, sending campers scrambling to pull hanging laundry and backpacks inside their tents. I was up early, packed, and on the trail by 7 a.m., ready to face another challenging day. Just like the previous days, the trail started steep and required plenty of bouldering, testing both balance and stamina.",
          "I paced myself better with water breaks today, even without any water sources along the trail, and I actually managed to eat most of my packed lunch, a couscous-based mix that kept me fueled for the climb ahead. Once at the summit, it was time to descend over steep drops and rough rock. From this vantage point, the coast and Calenzana were visible far below, and we enjoyed our lunch on an exposed rocky platform while taking in the view of where we would be staying that night.",
          "The journey down took about an hour and a half and felt far more pleasant than the previous day. Most of the descent was through large, well-spaced forest trees, allowing a cool breeze to flow through. After several switchbacks and sections where we had to choose our own route, we finally reached the bottom. Some in our group had booked rooms at the nearby hotel, while others, including me, pitched tents in a shaded, flat spot ideal for camping.",
          "Despite being mostly vegetarian, I couldn't resist the call of fries and a burger at the hotel restaurant. It was satisfying, and I followed it with a long, much-needed nap in the cool summer breeze. To prepare for tomorrow, I treated myself to a fancy buffet breakfast at the hotel instead of the lighter fare offered at the refuges. With a long day ahead, I plan to wake around 5:00 a.m. to get an early start.\n"

          "Today was the longest day on trail so far, both in mileage and time. The hotel breakfast buffet was incredible and exactly what I needed to fuel up: eggs, sausage, and plenty of bread set me up for the climb ahead. With a full belly, I packed my gear and hit the trail, ready to face the biggest challenge yet.",
          "Since we had descended yesterday to reach Ascu Stagnu, it meant an immediate uphill start this morning. The climb began through a beautiful forest with clear views of the surrounding mountains and a well-maintained trail. There was a tricky river crossing where I hopped across the rocks, and soon after the terrain became steep and rocky, requiring scrambling and chains in some sections. Many hikers were struggling on these spots, but the views kept me motivated.",
          "After about 90 minutes, I reached the first of two cols for the day and explored the plateau, discovering a small waterfall where I refilled my water. It was buggy, so I didn't linger long before heading toward the high point of the day. The final climb involved switchbacks on loose scree, walking over snow patches, and scrambling through slippery snowmelt with no chains to assist. It was challenging, but the moment I reached the summit, the view was worth every step. Clouds floated below me, and I could see the trail stretching ahead across the mountains, teasing the tricky descent that awaited.",
          "The descent was just as demanding as the climb, with loose scree and sandy dirt making footing precarious. Some sections were narrow and exposed, requiring careful focus, and it took about two hours to safely reach lower ground. By mid-afternoon, I arrived at Auberge U Vallone, a charming spot with excellent dining views. I set up my tent near some trees to dry my gear, enjoyed a hot shower, and watched hikers take dips in a nearby icy waterfall pool.",
          "Dinner was veal, a first for me on this trek. Corsican cuisine has been tempting my vegetarian habits, and I didn't regret the indulgence. My feet were starting to develop blisters, so I wrapped them as best I could, and I resolved to switch to more durable socks and hiking shoes moving forward. Despite the challenges, today was an incredible day of climbing, scrambling, and breathtaking scenery.\n"

        "excerpt": "Today was the longest and most challenging day on trail, with steep climbs, loose scree, and snow patches to navigate. Reaching Auberge U Vallone by mid-afternoon, I rewarded myself with a hot shower, a dip in a nearby waterfall, and a delicious dinner.",

          "Today promised to be an easier day than yesterday, and I started it with a breakfast of hot chocolate and bread with butter. I felt energized and ready to move quickly as we left the Auberge and headed onto the trail. The path wound through the trees and along rocky sections, offering plenty of lookout points to admire the expansive forested valley below. Small rivers fed by waterfalls crossed our path, and several fallen trees added some natural obstacles along the way.",
          "After about 30 minutes, the trail shifted from dirt to rock and began a steep ascent up the mountainside. I took frequent breaks to catch my breath, but my knees were holding up well, though one of my knee pad straps was starting to fail. Halfway up, we stopped at a large waterfall to refill our bottles and soaked our hats in the ice-cold water, which was as refreshing as it sounds.",
          "By 9:00 am, we reached the top of the col and finished the most challenging section of the day. The Mediterranean Sea was still visible from these high vantage points, a stunning reminder of how far we had come. We paused at Refuge Miori for a short break, where I tried my first Orangina, a sweet, fizzy drink similar to an over-the-top Fanta. The sugary boost was exactly what I needed for the remainder of the hike.",
          "The descent from Refuge Miori was much easier, mostly dirt with a gentle slope. We passed a pair of cows resting in the bushes and paused to take in the view behind us, amazed at how far we had climbed in just an hour. Along the way, we came across cascading waterfalls and even stripped down to our underwear to take a quick, ice-cold swim on a flat rocky platform. It was invigorating and perfectly refreshing.",
          "Later in the day, a herd of goats and their owners crossed the trail, slowing us for a short while before we reached a small food stand selling cheese-filled pancakes and lasagna. The pancakes were delicious and provided a much-needed snack. We continued through lush forests, occasionally speeding up to enjoy the trail, and finally arrived at our hotel. There, we relaxed with a deck of cards, bought some sturdier flip flops for around camp, and enjoyed the biggest dinner of the trip so far: steak with fries, egg salad, and dessert. Tomorrow promises to be the easiest day yet, but I'm already looking forward to every step.\n"

          "I started the day with breakfast while watching the sun rise over the mountains, and by 7:00 am we were on the trail. The first part of the hike was a gentle introduction, winding through open woods with plenty of clearings that offered beautiful views of the surrounding peaks. The path was mostly flat for nearly three miles, and even the sections that required some ascending were easy enough to enjoy without feeling strained.",
          "Once we reached the upper portion of the trail, the terrain became more exposed and rocky. The path zig-zagged across rugged hills and through rocky columns, eventually giving way to lush green hills. From the summits, we caught our first glimpse of Lac de Nino, a mountain lake that looked pristine from above.",
          "As we descended toward the lake, we realized it was surrounded by a bog. Walking across required caution to avoid stepping on soft spots, and some areas already had large holes exposing the water beneath. We didn't swim in the lake, but we paused on some boulders at its edge for a quick break before continuing on the trail, which thankfully remained flat for several miles. The white stone path cut a clear line through the bright green grasses of the surrounding plains, making the walk both easy and scenic.",
          "We stopped at the next Bergerie for a short break, tackling some incredibly hard bread and washing it down with Orangina. From there, we crossed open plains toward Refuge de Manganu, arriving mid-afternoon. The campsite was lively, and we noticed cows wandering through the area and nudging tents with their horns. We rigged up a makeshift fence with rope and rocks to keep them at bay.",
          "Next to the refuge, a river flowed with wide, flat areas perfect for cooling off, so we spent some time relaxing in the water. Dinner at the refuge was simple but satisfying: pasta with red sauce, bread, a small portion of meat, and dessert. As the sun set, it cast a warm, golden glow over the eating area, creating a cozy atmosphere that made for a perfect end to another day on the trail.\n"
        ],
        "excerpt": "The trail today took us from easy wooded paths to exposed rocky hills with breathtaking views of Lac de Nino. After a relaxing river break and a simple but hearty dinner at Refuge de Manganu, the day ended perfectly under the setting sun.",

          "Day seven started with a chilly morning that hinted at the long day ahead. The trail out of the refuge led us through boggy ground before beginning the climb toward a distant mountain ridge. The sun was still rising, leaving the trail in shadow as we carefully navigated shrubs and rocks. At one point we took a wrong turn and had to backtrack, but eventually we reached the top after about two hours. The stony summit offered a well-earned break, with a dizzying drop stretching out below us.",
          "The descent to the next ridge was more manageable, though some sections required scooting down on our butts, and chains helped us navigate the trickier spots. We chose the lower route over the upper section, avoiding sharp, jagged rocks. From there, the trail ran along the mountainside, windy and cold, as we followed the contours of the ridge.",
          "After about an hour and a half, the flat trail ended and it was time for another ascent, this time to a snow-patched area with icy waters. I dunked my feet into the freezing water to refresh them, careful not to go in fully as the water was a bit murky. Refreshed, I continued toward the next refuge for the night, descending steep switchbacks and slippery rocks along the way.",
          "The campsite promised another challenging night for tents, as the ground was hard-packed and required rocks to hold down stakes. Despite that, the refuge itself offered some much-needed comforts, including sundaes, eggs, and fries for lunch. I enjoyed a plate piled high, along with a soda and a sundae, without a hint of guilt.",
          "Dinner was served with pre-assigned seating, so our group was split up, but the conversation was lively nonetheless. Fellow hikers were amazed that I had come all the way from Chicago just to take on this trek. Afterward, we played cards together, and everyone is looking forward to tomorrow's refuge, which reportedly serves amazing lasagna. It was another day filled with adventure, breathtaking views, and moments of camaraderie on the trail.\n"
        ],
        "excerpt": "Today the trail led through boggy terrain, windy ridges, and icy snow-patched waters, challenging both balance and endurance. By the time I reached the refuge, I was ready for a hearty meal of fries, eggs, and a sundae to celebrate the day.",

          "I slept reasonably well despite the persistent wind, bundling up with pants over my shorts and a pullover to stay warm. The temperature dropped to 53˚F, and the wind made it feel at least 15 degrees colder, but my sleep system and tent held up perfectly. Breakfast was jam on toast with chocolate milk, and I was treated to a beautiful cloud inversion: a rare and stunning sight in the early morning.",
          "The descent started off steep, requiring careful navigation from ledge to ledge using trekking poles for support. Eventually, the trail eased into a more gradual downhill, passing countless waterfalls and grazing cows along the way. Before reaching the halfway point, we stopped at a Bergerie to try their quiche. The cheese was disappointing, but the bread was solid, and the break gave us a chance to rest before continuing.",
          "After the Bergerie, the trail became a dream for walking. The flat path cut through a forest of tall, widely spaced trees, with a wide river running beside us over smooth boulders. At the bottom, a bridge spanned the river and beneath it lay a swimming spot where we braved the icy water. Some even jumped from the bridge into the river, embracing the chill before beginning the next climb.",
          "The final push to the refuge involved a gradual ascent over wide trails and then narrower, rockier paths as we worked our way up green hills. Camping was set in a grassy field, which made pitching a tent much easier, though not perfect. I finally took my first cold shower of the trip, definitely a refreshing change from the many hot showers we'd enjoyed so far.",
          "Dinner was slightly delayed, and while the lasagna was just okay, seconds were available, and dessert was chocolate mousse. Afterward, our group said goodbye as everyone split up for the next day. Some planned a double hike while others rested in Vizzavona. I had a hotel room waiting there, eager to take advantage of their laundry services. The night promised to be chilly, but it felt good to reflect on a day full of waterfalls, swimming, and shared memories with friends I'd made along the trail.\n"
        ],
        "excerpt": "The day took us down steep trails, past waterfalls, and through forests with rivers running alongside. We capped it off with a cold river swim, a challenging climb to the refuge, and a final evening with friends before everyone split up.",

          "I woke up while it was still dark, and the campsite was damp with condensation from clouds that had rolled in overnight. Packing up was quick since today ended at a hotel, and I was looking forward to a warm shower and dry clothes. The ascent out of the refuge was steep, and a fog slowly crept in, obscuring the trail, but the views from the top made it worth every step. From that high vantage point, I watched clouds roll over the ridge below while the sun shone behind them, creating the most stunning cloud inversion I have ever seen. I lingered there for a long time, completely captivated.",
          "The remainder of the climb to the day's high point was manageable, but the descent on the other side was treacherous. My ankles twisted as I navigated smooth rocks and leapt from boulder to boulder along the steep path. It felt relentless at times, yet eventually the trail flattened out, and the final stretch wound through peaceful forest. The transition into a forest preserve with wide gravel paths made the walk almost effortless.",
          "Arriving at the hotel at 10:45 am was a little early, so I waited for the room to be ready. I passed the time at a local bar in town, a tiny cluster of buildings with a train station, enjoying drinks and snacks. Prices were surprisingly high for such a small place, even higher than at the mountain refuges. Once the room was ready, I laid out my gear to air, took a long shower, and indulged in a nap as rain gently fell outside.",
          "Dinner followed soon after, and though it was nothing extravagant, it hit the spot after a long morning on the trail. I had time to relax and appreciate the comforts of a proper hotel, from laundry to a soft bed. Breakfast is set for 7:00 am tomorrow, giving me a later start, which works fine since the day is only a five-hour hike. It's a nice chance to catch my breath and recharge before continuing the trek.\n"

        "excerpt": "The steep ascent out of the refuge was rewarded with a stunning cloud inversion that left me lingering at the summit. The rest of the day was easy, ending at a hotel where I enjoyed a long shower, a nap, and a much-needed break from the trail.",

          "Sleeping in felt amazing this morning, though breakfast at the hotel was as plain as the refuges. It started raining while I ate, which delayed my departure by about an hour, but as soon as the rain stopped I was back on the trail. The southern sections of the trek are noticeably easier, with wide, well-maintained paths and gentle terrain. Rivers and waterfalls were overflowing from the recent rains, which made some crossings tricky, but it didn't slow me down too much.",
          "I reached the Col above Vizzavona in just one and a half hours. The wind was fierce up there, nearly blowing my hat away, and I spotted several bright orange-and-black Fire Lizards sunning themselves along the trail. My energy was high, and I pressed on until I arrived at Capenelle, the original destination for the day. This ski lift area wasn't the most scenic place to camp, but it is known for its pizza, and I took a long lunch to enjoy a massive, delicious slice.",
          "After Capenelle, the trail remained flat and easy, with occasional gentle ascents and descents. I passed several abandoned refuges, wandered through pine-wooded mountainsides, and caught sweeping views of the valley. The route even included a short stretch along a road, though most of the day was spent surrounded by forest. At one point, I realized I hadn't seen anyone else on the trail for quite a while.",
          "The rain returned off and on, but the canopy of trees kept me mostly dry. Despite the dreary weather, I had plenty of energy and was making excellent progress. Eventually, after about an hour of uncertainty, I came across Bocca di Verdi, an official refuge reachable by road. I considered pushing on toward a more rustic campsite, but after 17 miles of hiking and with the next refuge two hours away, I decided to stay.",
          "Bocca di Verdi was cozy and inviting. I pitched my tent under the tree cover, giving me a flat, sheltered spot, and then headed to the main building to read in front of the fireplace. Dinner was hearty, and dessert was chocolate mousse once again. The sun kept trying to peek out from behind the clouds, and the wind promised a lively night in the tent. One of my socks now has a heel hole, but it is a small concern compared to the joy of finishing a full day on this trail.\n"

        "excerpt": "After a long day of 17 miles, I finally arrived at Bocca di Verdi, a cozy refuge with tree-covered camping and a warm fireplace. The southern trails were easier, but overflowing rivers and wind made the journey memorable.",

          "Today was a relentless up-and-down kind of day, with nearly eight hours on the trail. The morning started wet, and I hurried through breakfast to get moving. The first stretch climbed steeply through the woods before leveling out into bright green fields crossed by a gentle river. The trail switchbacked to a Col, and by the time I reached the top, the wind was fierce and icy, forcing me to pull on my windbreaker for the first time this trip.",
          "From the Col, the Mediterranean Sea stretched out in the distance, and the clouds rolled past in dramatic waves. I passed Refuge Prati, which looked incredibly uninviting, and later learned it was miserable inside, with many hikers forced into the eating area to sleep because the tents could not withstand the wind. The trail ahead twisted along ridges and narrow paths, often with steep drops on one side, and the fog reduced visibility to about thirty feet, making even familiar terrain feel treacherous.",
          "Climbing over fields of loose boulders in thick fog was particularly nerve-wracking, but eventually the clouds lifted and revealed the trail stretching out ahead. The route wound along a mountain ridge and through trees, looping through Col after Col before finally beginning the descent to the refuge. The camping area was exposed, and I had to navigate past some territorial horses before finding a spot to pitch my tent.",
          "The wind made things challenging. While waiting for dinner, the tent collapsed under gusts, forcing me to reinforce the stakes with rocks and add extra guy-lines. Dinner itself was outdoors in a drizzle, as the refuge lacked a covered eating area. Fortunately, I was able to purchase a sturdier tent on-site, which made the rest of the night much more comfortable.",
          "Despite the difficult conditions, the views and terrain made the day worthwhile. From foggy ridges to sunlit clearings, the trek continues to be a spectacular mix of challenge and beauty. Even the frustrating moments, like battling the wind and navigating slippery boulders, became part of the adventure. Each Col conquered reminds me why I came here, and I fell asleep feeling accomplished and ready for the next day.\n"
        ],
        "excerpt": "The day was full of fog, wind, and endless ridges, but the views of the Mediterranean and rolling clouds made every step worthwhile. Battling collapsing tents and slippery boulders became just another part of this unforgettable adventure.",

          "The night was long and uncomfortable, with howling wind and persistent rain. I couldn't fully stretch out in the tent, so I curled up at odd angles just to get some rest. Thankfully, by morning the sun was shining, and the tents kept out all signs of the previous night's storm. It felt good to start the day in sunlight rather than the damp gloom I'd slept through.",
          "The trail began with some moderate scrambling along mountain ridges. From a distance, these ridges looked easy, but once I reached them, the ups and downs were deceptively challenging. I even lost the trail a couple of times, as markers were difficult to spot in the dense vegetation. Once past the ridges, I raced down muddy switchbacks and entered a stretch of rolling green hills dotted with boulders. The southern portion of the trail lived up to its reputation for being easier, and I made great time.",
          "Rivers and streams cut across the path, creating some fun watery crossings. The greenest landscapes of the trip appeared here, and I was grateful for the gentle pace. The trail then meandered through local farmland and past small non-refuge accommodations. I considered stopping for breakfast but the places weren't open to non-guests yet, so I pressed on. Later, I wandered through lush vegetation and stumbled across an abandoned house before finally finding the trail markers again, which took some effort.",
          "After this, the trail turned to dirt and gravel roads and led me through verdant landscapes with rivers running alongside. I attempted to stop for lunch at a local spot, but the kitchen wasn't open yet, so I kept moving. The afternoon brought a steady ascent along hilly terrain, dotted with boulders and picturesque views. I was surprised to find one of the highest points in the southern section, nearly 6,500 feet above sea level, shrouded in clouds. The descent was brutal after a long double-stage day, and my knees were feeling every step, but I still made it to the refuge an hour ahead of schedule.",
          "Dinner was satisfying, and my gear stayed dry despite the clouds moving in. The refuge offered little in communal spaces, and temperatures dropped quickly, so I spent most of the evening reading in my tent. Even with the challenges, the day had a satisfying rhythm of climbing, descending, and soaking in the quiet beauty of the southern mountains.\n"
        ],
        "excerpt": "The southern portion of the trail offered rolling green hills, rivers, and clouds drifting over high peaks, making for a stunning day despite challenging descents. After racing through two stages, I arrived at the refuge early and spent a quiet evening reading in my tent.",

          "Last night was one of the scariest I've had on the trail. Horses wandered into the campsite after everyone had gone to sleep, passing dangerously close to my tent. The full moon lit the area just enough to keep them from running into anything, but when dogs started barking, the horses bolted and galloped through the camp. I spent much of the night wide awake, heart racing.",
          "The morning brought the final day on trail, though I didn't fully realize it yet. After several days of double-stage hikes, I wasn't sure I could handle nearly 20 miles, so I initially planned to stop at the last refuge. The early morning trail dropped into a valley, then crossed to the other side before leveling out. Waterfalls and tiny rivers punctuated the hike, but for the most part, the terrain was even and easy to navigate.",
          "The path then led into a sun-exposed, desert-like section, and sure enough, I got lost again. Missing a trail marker sent me scrambling, bushwhacking, and climbing my way back to the correct route. From that point, I kept a sharp eye on markers as the trail climbed through a forested section and a large public park. The dirt path was wide and flat for a stretch, but eventually it gave way to another steep ascent toward a mountain top.",
          "After countless ups and downs, I finally reached the last refuge on trail. The campsite was chaotic, with cows and horses wandering freely, so I decided not to stop. I pushed onward, even as my feet screamed in protest. Three hours of relentless climbing and descending later, I reached a rocky pass signaling the trail's end. A final 30-minute sprint downhill brought me to the paved road of Conca, and the official finish of the trek. I collapsed at a bar, celebrating with my first American hiker I'd met along the way.",
          "Reflecting on this journey, I can say it was the hardest trek I have ever done, but also the most rewarding. I met incredible people, faced intense physical and mental challenges, and experienced some of the most beautiful terrain in the world. Completing this thru-hike also marked the culmination of a personal list of treks I set back in 2018, and finishing it brought an unmatched sense of accomplishment.\n"
        ],
        "excerpt": "The final day of the trek was long and grueling, with countless ups and downs, challenging terrain, and wandering livestock to contend with. Crossing the finish line in Conca brought relief, celebration, and the realization that this was the hardest but most rewarding hike I've ever completed.",

          "Although commonly known as the Tomb of Ramesses VI, it was actually started by his nephew, Ramesses V, who was likely the first one buried here before his uncle expanded it for himself. The descent was a staggering 117-meter corridor that plunged deep into the limestone. What immediately hit me wasn't just the scale, but the colors. After over 3,000 years, the reds, golds, and deep blues of the hieroglyphs look as though the painters just finished their work this morning.",
          "The walls are a literal library of the underworld. On the left, the Book of Gates guides the way; on the right, the Book of Caverns. The highlight, though, is the burial chamber. I spent most of my time looking up at the astronomical ceiling. It features a magnificent, double-elongated image of the sky goddess Nut arching across the cosmos, swallowing the sun at dusk and giving birth to it at dawn. Below her, the reconstructed green conglomerate sarcophagus sits as a haunting centerpiece.\n"

You can really sense the haste in which it was prepared. Unlike the other pharaohs who were moved to museums long ago, Tutankhamun himself remains here. I stood inches away from his actual mummy, which is now preserved in a glass case at one end of the burial chamber. Seeing his linen-wrapped form in the very place he was laid 3,000 years ago is amazing.",

          "The air was crisp as we adjusted our packs at the Blue Spring Lake trailhead this morning. This 5.5 mile stretch of the Ice Age Trail is exactly what I wanted: a gentle introduction to overnight backpacking for me and my partner.",
          "The Blue Spring Lake Segment didn't waste any time showing off. Almost immediately we were climbing. The trail here twists through dense oak forests with a ruggedness that caught my calves by surprise, with near constant up and down portions as we went over several kettles and morraines left behind by the glaciars from long ago.",
          "The highlight was definitely Bald Bluff. Standing at 1,050 feet, we had a panoramic view of the Southern Kettle Moraine that made the steep ascent worth every breath. As I transitioned into the Stony Ridge Segment, the terrain leveled out into a more 'Midwest Nice' rhythm.",
          "Finally we arrived at Stony Ridge Shelter #2. It's a classic Adirondack-style lean-to perched on a ridge with a solid view of the surrounding kettle depressions. We pitched our tent inside of the shelter. After a day of climbing one hill after another and navigating over tangled tree roots, the quiet of the woods here is the perfect end to the trek.",
          "The next day we repeated the path to the shelter which didn't seem to take as long as the intial hike out to it.\n"

        "excerpt": "The Blue Spring Lake segment of the Ice Age Trail offered a perfect introduction to overnight backpacking with its rolling oak forests and challenging climbs. Bald Bluff rewarded us with panoramic views, and Stony Ridge Shelter provided a peaceful spot to rest for the night.",

          "The hike from Butler Lake today was a reminder of why they call the Northern Kettle Moraine 'hummocky.'",
          "We (me and some backpackers from a local meetup group) started the morning at the Butler Lake trailhead. The first mile or so felt like a geography lesson come to life. I spent most of it walking along the spine of the Parnell Esker; a narrow, winding ridge of sand and gravel left behind by an ancient subglacial river. Looking down through the bare trees at the 158-acre Butler Lake State Natural Area, you can really see how the glaciers sculpted this place into a messy masterpiece of kames and kettles.",
          "The trail between Butler Lake and the Parnell Tower area is only about 4.5 to 5 miles, but it's a leg-burner. The Parnell Segment is notorious for its constant ups and downs. The elevation changes had me working harder than I expected for a five-mile stretch.",
          "Before reaching the shelter, I took the mandatory detour up to the Parnell Tower. Climbing those 60 steps to the top gave me a bird's-eye view of the entire forest canopy. Low clouds hung in the sky, but we could still see for miles, and it's the highest point in the Kettle Moraine State Forest.",
          "Parnell Shelter is a rustic Adirondack-style wood structure, tucked away from the main Parnell Tower loop to give backpackers some peace. There was a stone fire ring and plenty of space for us all to gather around it for tales and ghost stories. It's quiet out here. I slept well at night, despite temperatures dipping below freezing.\n"

          "The trek from Parnell Shelter to the trailhead was a solid 8 mile push through green pinewoods. The morning started easy as we descended from the high ridges around Parnell. The trail quickly transitions from the Parnell Segment into the Greenbush Segment at Highway 67.",
          "The middle of the hike was a leg-burner. The trail here doesn't just go around the kettles; it dips into deep, damp valleys and then climbs right back out onto narrow moraine ridges. I passed through dense stands of oak, maple, and pine, navigating a narrow footpath that was often tangled with rocks and roots.",
          "The final stretch took me toward the Greenbush Recreation Area and finishing at the Greenbush Trailhead. I'm wiped but satisfied. This segment really makes you earn every mile with its constant elevation changes, but the views of those ancient glacial depressions are worth the sweat.\n"

      "Filled with misty glens, deep lochs, and endless rain while hiking from Milngavie to Fort William, the West Highland Way is a long-distance trail in the highlands of Scotland, UK spanning 97 miles. The trail travels down many ancient roads and old coaching routes, journeying from the lowlands to the highlands, while camping overnight in fields, along lakeside beachs, and under bridges.",
      "I was not prepared for the amount of rain nearly every day of this trek that took 6 days to complete, and by the end of it I was chilled to the bone. But I witnessed some amazing mountains once I got into the Highlands."

          "A good thru-hike always begins with the familiar mix of anticipation and nerves, full backpack, fresh clothes, and the uneasy excitement of walking toward the starting point. I left my hotel in Glasgow at 7 a.m., stomach empty and mind buzzing with questions about what the day would bring. First priority: breakfast. Luckily, a familiar fast-food spot came to the rescue. I grabbed a quick meal and hurried to the train station, determined not to be late on day one.",
          "Navigating the station was straightforward, though the local platform required a bit of detective work. The train arrived on time, and I found a seat across from another hiker carrying a large pack. A simple question about the West Highland Way sparked an instant connection. We would hike together for the first day before parting ways on the second. A short ride later, we arrived in Drymen, and the first order of business was securing a proper breakfast at a local grocery store before heading to the trailhead.",
          "The start of the West Highland Way did not disappoint. A small obelisk and an archway with the trail's name marked the beginning in a way that felt celebratory. After some quick photos, we set off, walking first through the town's outskirts before entering open farm fields and pastures. Stone walls, wooden fences, and green hills stretched out in all directions, while trail markers guided our path. Clouds hung heavy overhead, threatening rain, but thankfully the weather held as we passed rivers, trees, and fields teeming with wildlife.",
          "By noon, we stopped at a charming trail-side café, \"Turnip the Beet,\" for a well-earned lunch. The sandwich was easily one of the best I'd had on the trail. Soon after, a light mist fell, prompting rain coats for a short stretch before the sun returned. Afternoon walking brought more pastoral scenery, with cows, sheep, and ducks keeping us company. Even a fenced-off \"Trolls Bridge\" added a touch of whimsy to the hike. Eventually, the dirt trail gave way to a quiet farm road, leading us to our first campsite just outside Drymen.",
          "We arrived around 3 p.m., set up camp, and enjoyed the relief of hot showers. After a snack and some rest, we cooked a simple pre-made dinner on the stove. Later, my hiking companion suggested a short trip into town for a pint, which provided a small taste of local life before returning to the farm. As the sun set, I settled into my tent, ready for an early start the next day, eager to continue the adventure along Loch Lomond's scenic shores. Day one had set the tone: challenging yet rewarding, with spectacular views and a sense of camaraderie that only the trail can provide.\n"

From an early-morning train out of Glasgow to green lowlands, stone walls, and misty fields, my journey on the West Highland Way started with good food, new trail friends, and the quiet excitement of finally being on trail again.",

          "The day began under a bright, cloudy sky. A promising start after a night of restless sleep. I packed up my tent and gear, then cooked a quick breakfast of oatmeal with dehydrated bananas on my compact stove, carefully balancing it on a rock to avoid the damp grass. My hiking companion from yesterday decided to take it slow, so I set off alone, ready to tackle the day's route with energy and anticipation.",
          "The trail led out of Drymen and quickly veered from the road onto a dirt path winding between two farms. Green fields dotted with yellow flowers gave way to rolling hills and forested preserves, where wide gravel paths cut through pine woods and areas of regrowth from past disturbances. The path gradually narrowed again into rocky dirt trails, offering glimpses of the Loch in the distance, though the route circled around before turning toward the massive hills ahead.",
          "Crossing a small stream, the trail soon transitioned to stone steps, signaling the start of a climb up the hillside. The path zig-zagged and looped, with fields and sporadic tree clusters surrounding me. After about twenty minutes of scrambling over loose dirt, I finally reached the top, greeted by expansive views of the Loch below and a sky that had cleared into soft, pillowy clouds. I paused briefly for photos and a quick snack before descending toward the town below.",
          "The descent was straightforward, though the trail was busy with weekend hikers. By noon, I reached a restaurant at the edge of the water for a well-earned lunch: a burger, fries, and a cold beer. After refueling I continued on the afternoon section of the hike. The trail climbed again, weaving through dense, warm woodland and eventually following the shoreline of the Loch, where the stony beaches stretched alongside the water.",
          "By late afternoon, I arrived at my reserved campsite on the beach, with sweeping views of the surrounding hills and mountains. I spent the evening setting up my tent against the gusty winds, hanging clothes to dry, reading, and taking a nap. A peaceful stroll along the water completed the day, which had offered a perfect mix of varied terrain, spectacular scenery, and satisfying meals. It was a thoroughly rewarding day on the trail, one that reminded me why I love long-distance hiking.\n"
        ],
        "excerpt": "A bright, cloud-filled morning gave way to green fields, forest paths, and a steady climb that finally revealed Loch Lomond in all its scale and beauty. From misty hills to a quiet lakeside campsite, the day unfolded with big views, good food, and the kind of trail miles that remind me why I'm out here.",

          "Gray clouds greeted me as I emerged from my tent, and a quick check on my phone confirmed what I suspected: rain was on the way. Breakfast was skipped in favor of a few protein bars, and I packed up quickly, donning my rain jacket and polyester joggers for what promised to be a wet day. By 8 a.m., the first raindrops began to fall, soaking the trail but doing little to dampen my spirits. My waterproof backpack and Altra trail runners gave me confidence as I set off along the coastline of Loch Lomond, weaving through green woods and open vistas with the water always in sight.",
          "The morning brought all the charm and challenges of Scotland's trails. Clouds clung to the surrounding hills, and rain slicked rocks demanded careful footing. I passed under the gaze of a pair of mountain goats calmly sheltering by the water and crossed several small wooden bridges spanning flowing streams and waterfalls. Moss-covered ruins dotted the landscape, hinting at forgotten history, while colorful wildflowers and lush foliage brightened the gray day.",
          "After an hour, I arrived at a hotel beside a massive waterfall. A perfect place to rest and dry off. While the kitchen wasn't open, a warm drink and fresh socks were a welcome relief from the cold and wet. An hour later, the rain had slowed, and I continued along the lakeshore, navigating a rocky, slippery path that tested my balance at every step. Flat sections of trail had turned into streams, forcing careful wading through muddy conditions. The persistent downpour and flooded paths made progress slow, but the scenery was stunning, even in the rain.",
          "Eventually, I reached a small hut with beds and a fireplace, tempting as a place to dry off and rest. But as the rainwater began creeping over the threshold, I opted to push onward toward my original destination: Bienglas Farm. Arriving around 4 p.m., I was relieved to find hot showers, a restaurant serving warm meals, and laundry facilities: a hiker's dream after a soaking day. Setting up my tent under a large leafy tree, I quickly changed into dry clothes, showered, did laundry, and settled in at the restaurant with other hikers, sharing stories and passing the time until nightfall.",
          "The relentless rain and cold left me craving comfort, so I decided to book a hotel for the next night. By 9 p.m., I was tucked in, looking forward to a warm bed, dry sheets, and the chance to rest before the trail continued. Despite the day's challenges, the combination of rugged Scottish scenery, wild encounters, and the camaraderie of fellow hikers made it a memorable chapter in the journey.\n"

        "excerpt": "Dark clouds and steady rain set the tone as the trail clung to the loch, turning paths into streams and rocks into hazards. Soaked through and worn down, I pressed on until hot showers, warm food, and fellow hikers offered a much-needed refuge from the downpour.",

          "The morning greeted me with a much drier outlook than the previous day. While dark gray clouds still lingered, patches of blue were beginning to peek through the sky. After a hearty traditional English breakfast, I shouldered my backpack and set off a bit later than usual at 8:30 a.m., ready to take advantage of the improving weather.",
          "The trail was still dotted with puddles from yesterday's downpour, making navigation a bit of a zig-zagging game. I occasionally skimmed the tops of puddles, but a slightly damp toe was far preferable to a fully soaked shoe. Waterfalls and rivers were raging from the recent rain, creating some tricky rock-hopping crossings, though nothing too hazardous. Soon enough, the trail climbed into dryer pastures, leaving the watery challenges behind.",
          "Much of the morning was spent walking briskly through yellow-grass fields and rolling hills, occasionally passing the ruins of old buildings. By 11 a.m., I had gained elevation above the fields and enjoyed wide, sweeping views of the surrounding mountains and valleys. Thickening clouds hinted that rain might return, and a gentle fog began to descend, adding a mysterious quality to the landscape. A short stretch through pine and conifer woods, with streams and vibrant greenery, offered a peaceful contrast to the open hills, though the serenity ended abruptly when I emerged into a deforested area, a stark reminder of human impact on even the most scenic trails.",
          "After navigating a series of stone bridges and small wooded patches, I returned to open green fields flanked by mountains, truly a spectacular sight even under heavy clouds. By 12:30 p.m., I reached my initially planned stopping point but, feeling energized and seeing the sky clearing, decided to push on toward Bridge of Orchy, a town I had planned to reach the following day. A lunch stop in a larger town at 1:30 p.m. refueled me before the trail carried me back into the mountains under bright sunshine. Wide, level paths made for fast progress, allowing me to cover impressive distance through dramatic hills and peaks.",
          "I arrived in Bridge of Orchy around 4:30 p.m., exhausted but exhilarated after a long day of walking. The campground was set along the river beside the town's namesake bridge, offering level spots for tents and access to proper bathroom facilities. I set up my tent, captured a few photos of the bridge and surrounding countryside, cooked dinner, and let my feet recover at a park table alongside fellow hikers. Rain returned around 7 p.m., a signal to retreat into the tent, but it was a satisfying end to a day full of wide vistas, varied terrain, and excellent progress. Only two days left on the trail now, and today had been a great one.\n"

        "excerpt": "After days of rain, a brighter morning brought dry clothes, open fields, and renewed energy. As clouds lifted and sunshine returned, the trail stretched wide through hills and valleys, carrying me all the way to Bridge of Orchy where I was reminded how a hard hike can still be a great one.",

          "Today promised a mix of sun and rain as I ventured deeper into the Scottish Highlands. I had a cabin reserved in Kinlochleven for the night; a welcome prospect after anticipating another rain-soaked day on the trail. After a simple breakfast of granola and dried banana slices, I packed up and set off at 8 a.m., ready for whatever the Highlands would throw at me.",
          "The trail began alongside the riverbank where I had camped, with forests providing a pleasant canopy to start the day. Wet conditions from last night made navigating rocks and roots a careful exercise, and before long, the forests gave way to scraggly grasslands with a large lake visible in the distance. Attempts at stopping for a proper breakfast at a nearby bed and breakfast were fruitless, so a quick protein bar kept me moving.",
          "By mid-morning, clouds had thickened, and rain began to fall, gradually intensifying into a steady downpour. I saw very few people along this stretch, and the isolation made the experience feel raw and wild. The mountains surrounding me were magnificent, and walking through this remote landscape with rain lashing down and not another soul in sight was exhilarating in its solitude.",
          "After nearly two hours navigating small passes and remote trails, the path led me to a paved road and The Kingshouse, a trail-side hotel. I spent a restorative hour there, enjoying hot food, changing into dry clothing, and letting my gear begin to dry. A fresh pair of socks and dry clothes instantly lifted my spirits, and by 1 p.m., I was back on the trail, this time under bright sunshine.",
          "The afternoon brought some of the most stunning mountain views yet, with deep blue skies contrasting sharply against dark stone peaks. After 90 minutes of awe-inspiring hiking, the trail began a long descent into Kinlochleven. The entrance to town was less picturesque than the Highlands I had just traversed, exiting near a factory, and I had to rely on Google Maps to navigate to the cabin. Once settled, I laid out my wet gear to dry, enjoyed a hot dinner from my remaining backpacking meals, and looked forward to a well-earned night of rest in a comfortable bed.\n"

        "excerpt": "Rain, mountains, and long empty miles defined the day as I crossed deep into the Scottish Highlands. After hours of solitude and steady climbs, the clouds finally parted to reveal dramatic peaks, blue skies, and a hard-earned descent into Kinlochleven.",

          "The last day on the West Highland Way brought a mix of rain, gray skies, and the lonely solitude that had marked much of this trek. I was heading for Fort William, my final destination, and though I couldn't say I was sad the hike was ending, I knew today would be a test of endurance. After some searching, I finally found the trail leaving town, beginning with a steep ascent into the hills and mountains before settling into a mostly flat route toward Fort William.",
          "The morning offered glimpses of partly sunny skies, and fjords appeared in the distance, hinting at the Atlantic's presence. The trail wound through a long, narrow valley flanked by scraggly, grass-covered mountains, weaving along the hillside. Exiting the valley, I climbed over small hills and through forests, my pace steady and unbroken, focused entirely on reaching the end. By now, the rain had begun, and my trusty rain jacket stayed on for most of the day.",
          "As I approached the final stretch, Ben Nevis, the tallest mountain in the UK, loomed in the distance. A summit attempt would have to wait for another day. The trail gradually descended to mostly flat ground, where I was fully exposed to a downpour, every step soaking my gear. The trail eventually met a sidewalk along a busy road, leaving the hills behind and entering the outskirts of Fort William. The waymarks helped, but I had to pull up Google Maps to locate my hotel and the trail's official endpoint.",
          "Unlike the ceremonious obelisk that marked the start, the West Highland Way concluded quietly: a simple bench, a statue, and a small sign declaring 'The end of the West Highland Way.' The streets were empty, the rain relentless, and no other hikers were around to share the moment. It was a muted, lonely ending to a trek that had been more challenging, and less rewarding, than I had imagined. I headed to my hotel, eager for a warm bed and a chance to dry out.",
          "The following day and a half were spent recuperating. With a small portable heater provided by the hotel, I slowly thawed, grabbed breakfast, and hunted down a souvenir pin for my collection. Reflecting on the experience, the West Highland Way had fulfilled a long-standing bucket-list goal, but it left me mostly disappointed. The journey was far from the idyllic adventure I had imagined, and it forced me to question whether I would ever attempt another thru-hike.\n"

        "excerpt": "The final miles to Fort William were soaking wet, quiet, and more about endurance than celebration. With rain falling and the trail ending not with fanfare but a simple bench, the West Highland Way closed on a subdued note leaving me tired, and reflective.",

          "Finally, I'm back in South America, back in Patagonia, and ready to tackle the legendary 'O' Circuit. My base for the next 11 days is Puerto Natales, and from there I took a bus to Torres del Paine National Park. This would be my first time thru-hiking a trail while camping every night and carrying all of my own food. My backpack, packed with ultralight gear and tent, probably weighed close to 30 pounds. A hefty load, but worth it for the adventure ahead.",
          "The trail started with a small hiccup: I took a wrong turn and almost ended up at a maintenance shed. Luckily, I wasn't alone: Charles and Adèle, two Canadian hikers, had also veered off. From that point on, we stuck together, sharing stories and laughs as we explored the park's incredible scenery. Rivers snaked through yellow-green grasslands, snowcapped mountains loomed in the distance, and patches of forest offered welcome shade. The trail itself was gentle, and it took only about three hours to reach our first campground, Serón.",
          "The quiet of the park was otherworldly. Low population density and remote landscapes made every step feel like a step into another world. Along the way, we crossed rivers swollen from last night's rain and paused briefly for a snack on a tree log, swatting mosquitoes while taking in the scenery. Soon enough, a wooden sign announced we had arrived at Campamento Serón.",
          "The campground was impressive: a large communal tent for cooking, raised tents on platforms, hot showers, and full-service bathrooms. Most of us camped in the open field, surrounded by tall yellowed grass, a picture-perfect setting framed by the surrounding wilderness. Rain started as we picked our spots and set up, but my pyramid-style Dyneema tent, lightweight yet windproof, held up brilliantly through an overnight storm that reached near-hurricane strength.",
          "Despite the wild winds, I slept soundly, listening to the occasional crinkle of my ultralight sleeping pad and feeling secure in my little shelter. Day one of the 'O' Circuit was a gentle introduction to the park's beauty, a perfect mix of adventure, camaraderie, and awe-inspiring landscapes. A promising start to what would become an unforgettable journey.\n"

          "What a way to wake up! The sun was bright, the sky scattered with pink-white clouds, and the tall grasses around my tent glowed golden in the morning light. Everyone else was slowly emerging as well, so it was time to make oatmeal, pack up, and prepare for another day on the trail.",
          "This morning, we walked through fields of golden grass that seemed endless. The scenery was breathtaking, but soon enough we began the steady climb up a hill, where the wind picked up and tousled everyone's hair. At the top, we paused to admire the view of a large lake below: a perfect reward for our effort. Descending the hill, the wind eased, and we found ourselves walking through forests of short, round pines and patches of trees recovering from past fires. A turquoise river ran nearby, and we even passed a checkpoint to have our permits checked without any issues.",
          "The trail transitioned through rolling fields of yellow grains and dark green flora, with snow-capped mountains steadily drawing closer. We navigated through marshy lands thanks to a well-maintained boardwalk, a small but essential feature that kept the hike manageable. The mix of landscapes made each step a new discovery, and the ever-present mountains reminded us why we were here.",
          "Eventually, we reached our refugio for the night: Dickson. Nestled on the shores of a large lake and encircled by trees, it offered a large field for tents. Learning from the previous night's winds, we all chose sheltered spots near trees or tall bushes to protect ourselves. Inside, the refugio offered a full kitchen, hot showers, and full bathrooms; luxuries that made the day's hike even sweeter.",
          "The real highlight, however, was the shoreline behind the refugio. I wandered along the rocky beach, snapping photos of the massive mountains that lined the far shore, some of which were actually across the border in Argentina! Standing there, taking in the scenery, I felt the full majesty of Patagonia, and knew that every step to get here was worth it.\n"

          "After another successful night of sleep, sheltered from the wind by trees and bushes, we woke to a muddy but manageable morning. My thin groundsheet from the previous night had already seen better days and was tossed, but it turned out we wouldn't need it for the rest of the trip.",
          "Most of the morning was spent hiking through hilly forested terrain, with occasional lookout points breaking up the walk. Wooden bridges helped us cross a few rivers, nothing too challenging, and the trail took a surprising right turn away from the distant mountains. The hike became rocky, signaling that the day's real highlight was approaching: a detour to a moraine and glacier just before reaching Los Perros, our campground for the night. Because fewer hikers took this route, we had the glacier mostly to ourselves: a peaceful, icy retreat. We waded into the freezing waters and soaked up the sun on the rocks, savoring the quiet and the view.",
          "Eventually, we continued to Los Perros campground. Nestled mostly in the woods, the sites were muddy but manageable. We chose the driest, safest spots, keeping an eye out for any potential tree hazards. The campground offered modern conveniences: hot showers, bathrooms, and a kitchen, though the dense woods meant there were more bugs than the previous sites. A nearby river provided water, which we filtered for safety.",
          "With camp set up, I took some time to relax in a sunny clearing, reading my book and enjoying the quiet. Other hikers used the downtime differently. Some napped, others chatted, but it was a welcome break after several days of hiking.",
          "Overall, the day was a perfect balance of effort and reward: forest trails, icy water, stunning glacier views, and a peaceful campsite to recharge. Patagonia was already proving itself to be unforgettable.\n"

          "My tent's bottom was covered in mud, but luckily only half of it had been affected, so it wasn't too much to worry about. Today's goal was ambitious: reaching Grey's Glacier and crossing the highest point of the trail. As soon as we left Los Perros behind, the climbing began in earnest.",
          "The ascent was grueling, especially after a few days of easier, near-level walking. I found myself stopping often to catch my breath, but the effort was worth it. The lush green forest gradually gave way to rocky, barren mountainsides dotted with snow patches. The higher we climbed, the more breathtaking the view became.",
          "After roughly 90 minutes, we reached the top of the pass. Spread out before us was the massive, white expanse of Grey's Glacier. I had never seen a glacier up close and from such a vantage point, and we spent over an hour just marveling at its scale and majesty. The sheer immensity of it was humbling, a reminder of nature's grandeur.",
          "The descent proved even trickier. We zig-zagged down narrow rock paths, crossed a long suspension bridge, and navigated dozens of forested switchbacks. The dense trees created a stifling atmosphere, pushing me to pick up my pace as I hurried down. Once on flat ground, I power-walked toward Refugio Grey, passing signs of wildlife along the trail: scat from pumas and other wild cats that kept me alert and motivated.",
          "Refugio Grey was a welcome sight. Its large field made for perfect tent setup, and the refuge itself was ideal for relaxing. I spent the evening in one of the adirondack-style chairs outside, enjoying dinner while watching the sun set over the mountains. A peaceful and satisfying end to a challenging day.\n"

          "Last night was a rough one. A particularly loud snorer kept me from sleeping, and my earplugs kept falling out. Today promised to be an easier day of hiking, with extra time to explore a side trail that offered incredible views of the mountain near our campsite.",
          "The morning trek took us through a forest of bleached trees, remnants of a fire from years ago. Purple flowers grew among the charred trunks, creating a striking contrast of colors. The trail followed the lake formed by the melting of Grey's Glacier, where small icebergs floated gently in the water. For a while, the glacier remained visible in the distance before the trail turned and it disappeared from view.",
          "All along the route, the trees had been permanently bent by the wind over the years, making for a fascinating sight. The trail itself was mostly rocky, with little shade from the sun. Signs of the old forest fire were everywhere, and the harsh environment was a reminder of nature's power and resilience.",
          "Eventually, we descended into a small valley and reached Paine Grande. A beautiful lake lay nearby, and after setting up our tents, we took a side hike along part of the 'O' Circuit known as The 'Q'. I chose a flat grassy spot for my tent, while others pitched theirs near rocky outcrops or bushes. Fences in the field hinted at how windy the area could get, though I didn't pay much attention at the time.",
          "The side trail provided stunning views of the lake and the sharp, jagged mountain next to our campsite. The waters were cold and shallow, and we spent a couple of hours venturing out into them. By the time we returned to camp, the wind had picked up. Our tents were holding strong, but it was clear that the night ahead would be a blustery one.\n"

          "What a windy night it was. Almost nobody slept, except perhaps those who had paid for a bunk in the refuge. Several tents, including my own, were battered by sudden gusts. One of my trekking poles bent with a loud crack that sounded like a distant gunshot. I tied some extra guyline around the center pole to secure it, and it held, allowing me a couple more hours of sleep.",
          "The morning made up for the night. The sun cast a bright pink light across the clouds near the top of the nearby peak, and the scene was breathtaking. Today's hike would take us through ghost forests and along a large lake, possibly connected to distant ocean currents. The peaks of Los Cuernos, \"the Horns,\" dominated the landscape and were in view the entire day. The trail was flatter and easier than yesterday, allowing us to make excellent time.",
          "Along the way, we took a side trek into Valley Frances, a wide circular valley nestled behind Los Torres. The valley was filled with vibrant green forests and unique rock formations along its edges. The trail was easy to navigate, winding along a fast-flowing river and through sandy and muddy terrain. After about an hour, we reached the valley center and took in the full 360-degree panorama, snapping plenty of photos.",
          "Two hours later, after returning to collect our packs, we arrived at Refugio Frances. The campsite was perched on a steep, tree-covered hill, giving everyone a raised platform to pitch their tent. My tent fit snugly, but I felt secure among the trees, shielded from the wind. The showers and cooking area were at the bottom of the hill, near the water. I only went down to shower and make dinner, preferring the quiet of my tent for the rest of the day.",
          "After dinner, I read for a while in my tent as the forest grew dark quickly. Sleep came early, with the knowledge that tomorrow we would hike to Chileno, our final refuge, and the day after that we would finally reach the Towers themselves.\n"

          "Today promised an incredible mix of terrain: sandy and stony beaches I hadn't expected to encounter in Patagonia, and rolling grassy fields. Our goal was Refuge Chileno, part of the 'W' section of the 'O' Circuit, and the base for anyone aiming to hike to the Towers.",
          "As we walked along the beaches, I spotted some water spouts in the distance. Another reminder that this trek has been nothing but spectacular views. After about ninety minutes, we left the water behind and returned to more familiar terrain. It was the same area we had passed through about a week ago when we first set out from the welcome center.",
          "The trail today was busier than usual, with day hikers crossing our path, which threw us off at first. Despite the increased traffic, I felt a strong sense of nostalgia. This was the same route I had day-hiked four years ago, nearly to the day. It brought back vivid memories, and everything felt oddly familiar.",
          "For this stop, I had booked a bunk bed, a welcome treat after six nights of camping. I didn't purchase the refuge dinner, opting to make my own backpacking meal instead. Others had also skipped the meal, though I couldn't help but notice it looked delicious. We went to bed early tonight, knowing we'd wake at 3 a.m. to hike in the dark to the Towers and catch the sunrise.\n"

          "The last day on the trail had arrived, the day of the Towers! I was thrilled to hike up to them for the second time in four years. Sleeping in a bunk bed last night was a real treat, and with everyone getting up at 3 a.m., there were no worries about disturbing anyone.",
          "It was going to be a long day: hike up to the Towers, watch the sunrise, hike back down, grab breakfast and our gear, and then continue all the way to the welcome center for our bus ride out. We packed our phone cameras, left our bags behind, turned on our headlamps, and set out into the pre-dawn darkness. Experiencing this trail in the dark was completely different from my previous day hike, but the clearly marked path made it easy to follow.",
          "Finding a good spot at the top took some effort, but eventually we settled in a sheltered area with enough space to set up our cameras for timelapse shots of the sunrise. Someone started singing \"The Final Countdown,\" which felt fitting as we stared intently at the towers slowly emerging from the shadows. It was a truly magical experience, and we all took turns capturing photos of the awe-inspiring peaks.",
          "Eventually it was time to leave and return to reality. The hike down was quick, all downhill, and the bus arrived shortly after we reached the bottom. That evening, our now-large group reunited for a pizza dinner, a perfect way to end the trek, surrounded by friends we had made along the way.\n"

          "Sleep did not come easy last night. The hostel in Pokhara was full, and the other guests stayed up late and snored loudly. Groggy and hungry, I gathered my things and packed outside to avoid disturbing anyone. The early morning meant no taxis were running, so I walked the ten minutes to the bus station, regretting taking a taxi the day before. A small food stand offered coffee, pastries, and a banana, which I devoured while waiting for the bus to Besishar.",
          "The bus ride to Besishar was long, bumpy, and crowded. Locals boarded with all sorts of items, including furniture, and space grew tight at times. I met the people who would soon become my hiking companions: Katie from New Zealand, Nathan from England, and Véronique from Canada. Nathan realized he had forgotten some essential gear, and we helped him purchase a down jacket and other items for the trek at very reasonable prices.",
          "Finally on the trail, we left the city behind and hiked into the jungle. The path led over a long, narrow suspension bridge spanning a rushing river and opened into bright green fields surrounded by vibrantly colored homes. We became so caught up in conversation that we got lost, relying on a friendly local family to guide us back to the trail. Once back on track, we pressed on, stopping briefly at a small waterfall where my water filter had sprung a leak. Katie's chlorine tablets saved the day.",
          "Crossing more suspension bridges, including one that looked ready to collapse, we finally reached Bhulbule, the village where we would spend the night. Exhausted and hungry, I ate some protein bars and took a much-needed rest on stone steps at the village entrance. Once rested, we began searching for accommodations. The teahouse system relies on local families, and we were lucky to find one with showers, clean rooms, and a dining area. The owner gave us a room for three, adding a fourth mattress to the floor for a discounted rate, provided we ate dinner there.",
          "The day was full of firsts: new friends, a long bus ride, getting lost in the jungle, and nearly collapsing from hunger. Despite the challenges, the warm showers and delicious food made everything worthwhile. It was an eventful start to the Annapurna Circuit, and I was eager to see what tomorrow would bring.\n"

        "excerpt": "The first day on the Annapurna Circuit was full of surprises, from meeting new friends to getting lost in the jungle. Exhausted but grateful, we ended the day in a welcoming teahouse with hot showers and good food.",

          "Day two on the trail started with a proper breakfast, a welcome change from yesterday's pastries. Eggs, sausage, and fresh bread fueled us for the day ahead, and everyone had slept well the night before. Without the pressure to get moving early, we took our time leaving the village and soaking in the morning air.",
          "Our path soon led past towering waterfalls, and the fine mist from the falling water felt refreshing as we began to climb higher along the river. Several suspension bridges required careful crossing, moving us back and forth over the rushing waters. The trail itself varied between gravel, dirt, grass, and occasional mud, with only brief stretches shared with passing jeeps.",
          "Lunch came at a teahouse perched on the cliffside, offering a spectacular view of the valley and terraced fields below. The veggie mo-mo and orange soda hit the spot, and we lingered over an hour, watching the sun move across the mountains. As we continued, an archway marked our entry into the Gandaki region, and higher elevations allowed us to look down on the trail we had traversed so far.",
          "A waterfall further along gave us a playful challenge, as hikers in front of us carefully navigated slippery stones, losing a few trekking poles and hats to the fast-flowing water. The trail wound along rock and dirt paths carved into the mountainside, with each bend revealing new vistas. Eventually, we arrived in Jagat, where a natural hot spring offered a steam bath at the river's edge. The hike down and back up was a little grueling, but the experience was worth it, as locals also used the waters for bathing.",
          "Near the village, a swaying suspension bridge provided the perfect photo opportunity. Our group posed quickly and moved along, wary of the precarious sway. Day two reminded us that the Annapurna Circuit is as much about patience and persistence as it is about awe-inspiring scenery.\n"

          "Today was filled with sun and some of the best mo-mo we've had on the trail so far. The terrain was varied, alternating between long flat stretches and constant elevation gains. We left Jagat and steadily climbed, following the side of a deep valley that offered a mix of lush scenery and small waterfalls along the way.",
          "After about four hours of steady climbing, the trail brought us to the riverbed we had been hiking alongside for the past two days. Walking along stony beaches toward a village perched on the water's edge, we stopped for a long lunch. The mo-mo here was hands down the best of the trip, a true highlight for half of us who are vegetarian. One of the local children spent much of the meal chasing their pet rabbit around, adding charm to the experience.",
          "After lunch, it was back into the mountains as the trail began to climb again. Two hours later, we arrived in Dharapani. Finding an affordable place to stay took some effort, and the village experienced intermittent power outages throughout the evening, a common occurrence in Nepal's mountains.",
          "Although the day's details blur a bit in memory, the combination of sun, scenic valleys, riverbeds, and memorable mo-mo made it another unforgettable day on the circuit. It reminded us that some days are best experienced rather than documented.\n"

          "Today, the mountains finally started to reveal their snow-covered peaks, giving us a glimpse of what was ahead. We crossed another suspension bridge out of town and entered thick forests, a mix of conifer and deciduous trees. A welcoming arch over the trail reminded us we were on a journey meant to be savored.",
          "The trail felt busier today, with hikers arriving from jeeps that bypassed the first sections of the route. It made us feel proud to be doing the full trek from start to finish, taking in every part of the Annapurna Circuit on foot. At the next village, we discovered rows of prayer drums. Spinning them clockwise is said to bring good luck, and we made sure to do it every chance we got.",
          "Another waterfall crossing marked the day, and this time we were fortunate to only lose a single hat. The rest of the hike was spent winding through colorful forests and crossing long suspension bridges. With each step, the peaks in the distance grew larger, snow glinting in the sunlight and promising the challenges to come.",
          "After six hours of hiking, we arrived in Chame, tired but exhilarated. Today reminded us that the circuit is not just about the villages or the paths, but about the small rituals, the bridges, and the ever-changing landscapes that make the journey unforgettable.\n"

          "We left Chame after a hearty breakfast, the sun already high above us as we followed the fast-flowing river that has accompanied us since the beginning of the trek. Shortly after setting off, we passed a monument declaring \"Buddha was born in Nepal,\" a reminder of the deep cultural history surrounding the trail.",
          "The path was busier than usual, with many porters passing by carrying enormous loads on their backs while walking in sandals. It was humbling to witness the sheer strength and endurance required for this work, and a stark reminder that these mountains demand respect. Another Buddha monument appeared around a bend, and we marveled at the way the trail had been blasted directly out of the vertical rock face. Despite sharing the path with jeeps and motorbikes, the trail was wide enough to navigate safely.",
          "As we gained elevation, the scenery transformed. Trees became sparse, revealing massive mountain faces and the stunning peaks of the Annapurna Massif. Every turn offered new perspectives, and the scale of the mountains made us feel small in the most awe-inspiring way.",
          "Our destination was Upper Pisang, and we arrived in time to settle into a beautiful teahouse with a view that took our breath away. The village is home to a Buddhist temple, and we didn't miss the opportunity to explore it. The temple's colors were unlike anything we had seen, a vivid feast for the eyes that made wandering its grounds a true delight. At this altitude, our puffy jackets were necessary for afternoon walks, a reminder that we were steadily moving into the high Himalayas.\n"

          "Sunrise in Upper Pisang greeted us with crisp air and breathtaking views of the Annapurna massif. As we packed up, we passed villagers carrying large bundles of sticks and hay up from Lower Pisang, a reminder of how hard life is in these mountains. Crossing a short suspension bridge brought us to a steep series of switchbacks that climbed nearly a vertical mile. At roughly 9,000 feet, the ascent was grueling, but the tiny village of Pisang shrinking below us made the effort feel worth it.",
          "The trail hugged the side of a sandy-colored mountain dotted with stone homes, ancient temples, and colorful prayer flags fluttering in the wind. At a small sparsely populated village, we took a break, surrounded by snow-capped peaks and the muted earth tones of the highlands. Some structures seemed abandoned, while others were still lived in, and we passed small temples dedicated to Buddha along the way.",
          "After hours of hiking, we rejoined the river that has accompanied us nearly the entire trek, walking along a dusty road past grazing yaks. Jeeps kicked up clouds of dust, forcing us to step aside and cover our faces, wishing for neck buffs we hadn't brought. At last, we reached Manang at 11,500 feet just before nightfall. We found a teahouse that felt right, and booked rooms for two nights, preparing for the day-hike to a glacial lake at 15,000 feet that would help us acclimatize before the highest point of the trek.",
          "The next morning, we set off early, water bottles and jackets in hand, retracing our steps from the previous day to reach the trailhead. The hike up was exhausting and cold, taking nearly five hours to reach the lake. The views from that elevation were jaw-dropping, a mix of glaciers, towering peaks, and glinting rivers. The cold was intense, and we couldn't stay long before our fingers began to freeze despite gloves. The hike down separated our group for a time, but we eventually reunited and returned safely to our rooms.",
          "That evening, we visited a small local movie theater hidden behind a bar and watched Everest. It was eerie and humbling to see the mountain on screen as we prepared to go higher than any of us had ever been. The film reminded us of both the awe and danger that lie ahead, making the upcoming days feel all the more real and intense.\n"

          "Saying goodbye to Nathan was harder than expected. He needed to press on to meet his timeline, which meant skipping the variant route to Tilicho Lake where we planned to spend the night before climbing to the world's highest freshwater lake at 15,500 feet. In the early morning hours, the three of us left Manang and crossed a suspension bridge at the edge of town, the day still quiet and cool.",
          "The trail quickly turned dramatic. We moved along steep mountain slopes that looked as if they had either just shed a landslide or were thinking about it. A few times, supply trains of donkeys clattered past us, and I held my breath, half convinced the loose stone beneath their hooves might give way. It never did, but the tension stayed with me.",
          "The landscape felt otherworldly, almost unreal. For nearly five hours we climbed and descended these sloping hills, gaining altitude with every step. By midday we reached a small cluster of teahouses in Shree Kharka and stopped to rest. We decided this would be our stopping point on the return from Tilicho Lake instead of pushing all the way to Thorong Phedi. The teahouses here were impossibly colorful, bright against the stark terrain.",
          "By the end of the afternoon, we finally reached Tilicho Lake Basecamp and were relieved to find what looked like the last available place to sleep. The catch was that it sat behind the main building in a small hut we would all share. Thin walls, windows with holes, and rough mattresses greeted us, but it was shelter, and that was enough.",
          "Dinner turned out to be excellent, which felt like a small miracle. My body is finally adjusting to a steady diet of cheap dal bhat and its endless refills. We spent the evening in the dining hall reading and playing cards before turning in early. Tomorrow would be an early start for the hike up to the lake.\n"

        "excerpt": "We said goodbye to a friend and stepped into an alien landscape on the way to Tilicho Lake Basecamp. It was a long, demanding day marked by loose trails, bright teahouses, and a simple but welcome place to rest before the climb.",

          "Stars crowded the cloudless pre-dawn sky as we packed up for our hike to Tilicho Lake at 16,435 feet. The cold made every movement feel heavier than it should have, and starting the day so early took real effort. With headlamps on and breath visible in the dark, we eventually found our way onto the trail.",
          "About an hour and a half in, sunrise began to spill over the mountains, slowly revealing a snowy white world around us. The first half of the climb felt manageable, but as we gained more altitude, our pace slowed and breaks became more frequent. Once the trail flattened out near the top, we found a second wind and reached the lake roughly two to three hours after starting.",
          "The lake itself was not striking in any obvious way beyond its extreme elevation. What truly defined the moment were the snow-covered peaks encircling us, towering and silent. As we stood there taking it all in, a low rumble echoed through the valley. High on one of the distant peaks, an avalanche broke loose and rushed downward toward the far side of the lake. We were not in danger, but watching it unfold was unforgettable.",
          "The cold quickly forced us to leave. Our fingers were going numb inside our gloves, even with layers on, and it was impossible to linger. As we started down, a second and much larger avalanche thundered down another slope, filling the air above the lake with clouds of powdery snow. We were too low to see it fully, but the sound alone was enough to leave us in awe.",
          "The descent was fast, as it usually is, and we moved quickly to warm ourselves back up. We skipped breakfast at Basecamp and pushed on to Shree Kharka, drawn by one teahouse with a dining hall overlooking the valley. The landslide-prone trail felt easier this time, and the day ended quietly with cards, podcasts, food, and plans for the next push toward Thorong Phedi, Thorong La Pass, and eventually Muktinath.\n"

        "excerpt": "An early start led us through a frozen sunrise to Tilicho Lake, surrounded by towering snow-covered peaks. Avalanches thundered in the distance before we hurried back down to warmth, food, and plans for the next high pass.",

          "Today marked our turn back toward Manang and then sharply away from the familiar valley as we aimed ourselves toward Thorong La Pass, the climax of our trek together. There was a quiet sense of transition in the air, the feeling that we were leaving one chapter behind and stepping into something more demanding.",
          "We left Shree Kharka and said goodbye to the sand-colored valley walls that had framed the past few days. As we retraced our steps, the landscape shifted to sparse, scraggly bushes clinging to the terrain. At an overlook above Manang, we stopped for photos and took a moment to acknowledge the completion of the first half of the circuit. Then we turned left, climbed steadily, and entered an entirely new valley.",
          "From there, the trail revealed itself all at once, winding and twisting across the landscape ahead of us. We marched on with our heads down, focused on closing the distance to Thorong Phedi. Lunch came at a stop offering teepees for sleeping, where we gladly rested, ate, and drank sodas before continuing on.",
          "The afternoon stretched on, with another three to four hours still ahead of us. We moved up and down rocky sections, crossed rivers, and passed through thin patches of forest, climbing higher even on a day where we technically lost more elevation than we gained. Every bit of uphill still demanded effort at this altitude.",
          "Nearly seven hours after starting, we finally arrived at Thorong Phedi. The mattresses were some of the hardest I have ever encountered, but the veggie burger more than made up for it, easily the best I have ever had. Tomorrow would be a slightly later start, giving us a chance to catch up on sleep before making our push over the pass.\n"
        ],
        "excerpt": "We turned away from Manang and began our final approach toward Thorong La Pass. A long, demanding day ended at Thorong Phedi with sore legs, hard beds, and a surprisingly unforgettable veggie burger.",

          "The big day had finally arrived: crossing Thorong La Pass and stepping into the second half of the circuit. While we would lose more elevation than we gained, the challenge of the day was unmistakable. We ate breakfast quickly, eager and a little anxious to get moving.",
          "The climb from Thorong Phedi to the pass was slow and deliberate. The trail was crowded, and starting at nearly 15,000 feet meant frequent stops just to catch our breath. It became a simple rhythm of putting one foot in front of the other. After three and a half hours of steady effort, we finally reached the pass.",
          "The sense of accomplishment was overwhelming. We dropped our packs and soaked in the moment, crouching together for photos beside the sign marking the highest point of the trek. Standing back up brought instant dizziness and light-headedness, a sharp reminder of how thin the air was. Even small movements left us winded, and it was clear this was not a place to linger too long.",
          "Eventually, we began the long descent toward Muktinath. The trail down felt fast and almost freeing after the slow climb, and we moved quickly, stopping once at a refuge for refreshments. After about three hours, the landscape opened up and we arrived in Muktinath.",
          "Muktinath felt like a small city compared to where we had been, full of shops, places to stay, and life. We checked into a spot called Bob Marleys, which felt luxurious after days on the trail. Hot showers, comfortable beds, and one of the best meals of the trek awaited us. My first-ever pasta carbonara sealed the day as one I will never forget.\n"
        ],
        "excerpt": "Crossing Thorong La Pass was slow, exhausting, and deeply rewarding. After the long descent, Muktinath greeted us with hot showers, comfortable beds, and delicious food.",

          "Our destination today was Marpha, at least for some of us. Katie, a friend from New Zealand, would be leaving the trail early to catch a bus from the town just before Marpha and head back to Pokhara to continue her travels. Veronique stayed behind briefly to call her boyfriend back home, so Katie and I said our goodbyes and started down the trail together.",
          "The path for the day led us over light-brown hills and mountains and along wide, dried riverbeds that must roar with water during other seasons. It was a welcome change from road walking, and the route felt quieter and more remote. As we descended out of the mountains, we crossed several suspension bridges that gently swayed beneath our steps.",
          "The day felt long, filled with constant ups and downs and very little change in the scenery. This stretch of the circuit was noticeably emptier, since many trekkers opt to take a jeep from Muktinath instead of walking on. That choice was obvious in the lack of people and the fewer options for places to stay along the way.",
          "A few hours later, we reached the town just before Marpha and stopped for lunch together. Over food, we said goodbye, knowing it would likely be the last time our paths crossed on this trek. As we finished eating, we spotted Veronique walking by, and after parting with Katie, I hurried to catch up with her. The thought of being alone again after eleven days with the same group made me uneasy.",
          "In Marpha, I initially found a place to stay on my own, but it was empty and uninspiring. After settling in, I wandered the quiet village and, by chance, ran into Veronique again. She had found a much better place to stay, so we went back, grabbed my things, and moved over. The new spot had a friendly host and comfortable beds, and best of all, the promise that tomorrow would not involve any hiking at all.\n"

          "With the group now reduced to just two, Veronique and I left Marpha and headed toward Ghasa. The day promised a mostly dusty trail, and before long a hopeful dog joined us, trailing behind for a while as if waiting for a handout or some attention.",
          "The landscape shifted constantly as we walked. We crossed bridges, passed through bright green fields, and moved in and out of forests broken up by frequent river crossings. Jeeps rumbled past us throughout the day, a reminder that much of this stretch followed the road. Somewhere along the way, I lost one of my flip-flops, though I never did figure out exactly where it happened.",
          "We also passed through apple orchards, a small but welcome contrast to the dust and traffic. Despite the variety in scenery, most of the trail stayed close to the road, with only a handful of places to stop. Many of them were empty or run-down, and food options were limited.",
          "Long stretches followed dried riverbeds, and the sense of isolation grew stronger as the day went on. We did not see any other hikers until we reached Ghasa, and even there they were few and far between. The trail felt quiet in a way that was both peaceful and lonely.",
          "In Ghasa, we found a place to stay with surprisingly decent rooms. Having our own rooms felt like a luxury, especially on the Annapurna Circuit where sharing is usually the norm. After a long and solitary day, the simple comfort was more than enough.\n"
        ],
        "excerpt": "A dusty, quiet day took us from Marpha to Ghasa with few hikers and long stretches of road. Small comforts at the end of the day made the solitude easier to carry.",

          "This was probably the most memorable day of the entire trail, and not for the reasons I would have hoped. My original plan was to stop in Tatopani, but when I arrived it was mostly locals and no other hikers. With the last member of my group heading back to Pokhara, I was about to be completely alone. Instead, I made a last-minute decision to follow an Australian couple who were continuing on toward Ghorepani.",
          "The descent from Ghasa was quick and almost effortless. We dropped into jungle terrain again, the air growing warmer with every step, a wide river rushing alongside the trail as we crossed suspension bridges. In just under three hours we reached Tatopani, the traditional endpoint of the circuit. I debated staying there and possibly starting the Annapurna Base Camp trek since I had far more time than expected, but it was still early and the Australians were moving on, so I went with them.",
          "They were much faster on the climbs, and before long I told them to continue ahead while I caught up later. From that point on, I was hiking alone. The trail was well marked, but the elevation gain was relentless, nearly 4,000 feet after Tatopani. I stopped seeing other hikers entirely for a while, only spotting a few as the sun began to dip lower in the sky.",
          "I had not eaten much since lunch and had run out of snacks, though I still had plenty of water. As temperatures dropped, I barely noticed. Adrenaline carried me forward even as my breathing grew labored and every step felt heavier than the last. When I finally reached the archway marking Ghorepani, relief washed over me, only to be replaced by dread when I realized I still had several long flights of stone stairs to climb.",
          "When I reached the teahouse where I had planned to meet the Australians, it was shuttered and abandoned. With no choice, I pushed on toward the center of the village, which was surprisingly busy due to hikers preparing for the Poon Hill sunrise. I stumbled into the first open lodge and asked for a room, drawing more than a few concerned looks. After being shown to a small room, I asked for snacks and a blanket and sat down, which is when things took a turn. My arms and legs began to tingle and go numb, and the sensation only worsened. I made my way back downstairs, and the hosts sat me by the fire, assuming I was simply cold.",
          "What happened next likely saved my life. A group of hikers nearby noticed me and quickly realized I was still wearing sweat-soaked clothes. They immediately helped me change into dry layers, wrapped me in my sleeping bag, and brought me back to the fire. One of them ordered hot, salty soup and more food, and after eating I finally fell asleep next to the warmth. Hours later I woke feeling clearer and far more stable. That night, after looking up my symptoms, I learned I had experienced mild hypothermia. If not for the kindness and quick thinking of strangers, I would not have made it. It was a hard lesson in how quickly small decisions can compound, and how lucky I was to walk away from it at all.\n"

          "The near-death experience from the night before was deeply humbling, but it also sparked an unexpected sense of energy. I woke up after a long, restorative sleep and walked downstairs to an empty dining hall. Nearly everyone had already left in the early hours to hike up Poon Hill for sunrise.",
          "While waiting for breakfast, one of the hikers who had helped me the night before came in. I thanked them again, knowing there was no real way to repay that kind of selfless kindness. When it came time to order, I made sure to get as much warm food as possible, determined not to repeat the mistakes of the previous day.",
          "With a full stomach and a renewed appreciation for simply being there, I set off toward Chomrong and the beginning of the Annapurna Base Camp trek. Thick fog hung over the village as I left, and the trail felt unusually quiet since many people do not take this route. The stillness suited the reflective mood I was in.",
          "For several hours I walked through rolling hills wrapped in fog before emerging into a forest filled with leaves of every color. It felt like autumn back home. The area turned out to be a protected forest, and families were out hiking together, bringing a gentle, joyful energy to the trail.",
          "After stopping at a small group of teahouses for lunch and fueling up properly, I continued on, this time into dense jungle. Monkeys suddenly appeared overhead, swinging through the trees, an incredible sight that also made me pick up the pace just in case. The trail eventually dropped steeply into a valley and climbed back up the other side, delivering me to Chomrong a few hours later. Despite gaining a surprising amount of elevation, the day felt lighter. I found a welcoming place to stay with sweeping views and some of the best food of the trip so far, including pizza that tasted especially earned.\n"

        "excerpt": "After a frightening night, the trail offered a sense of renewal and perspective. Foggy hills, autumn forests, and unexpected kindness carried me safely to Chomrong.",

          "Well rested and well fed, I left Chomrong the next morning to begin the Annapurna Base Camp trek. I would not make it all the way that day, but I covered a good amount of ground and eventually stopped in a place called Deurali. It felt good to be moving forward again with a clear goal ahead.",
          "The day was almost entirely uphill. Leaving Chomrong meant descending all the way to the valley floor before climbing straight back up the other side. The constant elevation gain put real strain on my knees and lungs, and the effort was impossible to ignore.",
          "Most of the trail wound through dense jungle, cool and green despite the effort it demanded. About halfway through the day I stopped for lunch, once again relying on pasta and a couple of cokes to keep my energy up. Not long after, I passed a fascinating stretch of caves with ice and snow forming natural bridges overhead, a reminder of how varied and surprising this trek could be.",
          "By the time I reached the next village, rain had started to fall and it stayed with me for the rest of the afternoon. I arrived in Deurali roughly six hours after setting out and was shown to a room shared with two other trekkers. I hung up my soaked clothes and hoped for the best, grateful at least for the hot showers waiting downstairs.",
          "That evening was quiet and comforting. I spent time reading in the dining hall before joining a group of British hikers who were playing cards over dinner. Tomorrow would be a big day, as the trail would finally lead to Annapurna Base Camp itself.\n"
        ],
        "excerpt": "The climb toward Annapurna Base Camp began with long jungle ascents and steady rain. Deurali offered warm showers, shared company, and a calm pause before the final push.",

          "The terrain began to change almost immediately after leaving Deurali on the way to Annapurna Base Camp. Green bushes and grasses slowly disappeared, replaced by bare rock faces dusted with thin yellow grasses as the valley narrowed and the mountains closed in around me. With every step higher, the landscape felt more stark and more dramatic.",
          "Walking through these massive rock formations made me feel incredibly small. After about an hour, the first patches of snow appeared underfoot. Less than sixty minutes earlier I had been moving through jungle, and suddenly I was surrounded by an entirely different world, cold and exposed.",
          "There was a refuge along the way where I could have stopped, but I wanted to reach the snow-covered heart of the valley, so I kept going. A helicopter droned overhead, repeatedly moving up and down the valley. I assumed it was resupplying the lodges, but later learned it was carrying tourists directly to Base Camp, skipping the hike entirely.",
          "As I continued, clouds began to build and the snow deepened. Fresh snowfall from the night before made the trail difficult to follow, and I had to carefully pick my way forward, occasionally stepping off the path entirely. Ahead, the outline of the Base Camp refuge slowly emerged as clouds thickened around me. Snow was clearly on the way again, but I arrived just in time.",
          "The hike from Deurali took no more than three hours, and I realized I could have made it the previous day if the rain lower down had not likely been snow at this elevation. With my cash running low, I shared a room with a French couple I had met earlier in Chomrong. After settling in and enjoying a hot shower, I spent the afternoon in the dining hall reading, eating, and watching the winter landscape outside the windows.",
          "The snowstorm passed after a few hours, leaving behind crystal-clear blue skies and drifting clouds that hovered low in the valley. I wandered outside to take in a nearby drop-off filled with a surreal cloud inversion before returning indoors to read more. A couple of resident dogs kept trying to sneak into the dining hall for warmth and food, much to the hosts' annoyance. Over meals, I made friends with a few Americans from Colorado and Washington. As night fell and the lights dimmed, I turned in early, hoping to wake up in time for sunrise at Base Camp.\n"

        "excerpt": "The trail to Annapurna Base Camp shifted quickly from jungle to snow-covered rock and cloud-filled skies. Arriving just ahead of a storm, I spent the day soaking in the silence and scale of this winter world.",

          "We woke in the pre-dawn hours, stiff from sleeping on hard mattresses in the cold, and quickly bundled up in all our layers. I joined the others as they headed toward a flat area above the refuges, perfect for watching the sunrise over Annapurna. The early morning stillness, paired with the crisp air, made the anticipation even more exciting.",
          "Watching the sun rise was nothing short of magical. The sky shifted from deep blues to soft pinks, and the mountain peaks began to glow golden. The snow at the summits stirred in the light, creating the illusion that the mountaintops were on fire. I stayed for over an hour, completely captivated by the view.",
          "After the sunrise, we headed back to the dining hall for a hot breakfast of eggs and cocoa. I planned to return all the way to Chomrong today, partly because I had already pushed almost to Basecamp in one long hike, and partly because I wanted the comfort of a good room. Others had told me it was possible to make the journey in a single day, so I felt confident in my plan.",
          "The initial part of the trail was slow-going thanks to fresh snow and compacted ice. After about an hour, I was past the snow and moving through the bushes and sparse grasses I had passed the day before. I didn't take many pictures, focused on making good time and motivated by thoughts of a room to myself and some well-earned pizza. I also had a small, irrational fear of encountering tigers, which kept me alert as I moved.",
          "Closer to Chomrong, more people began appearing on the trail, a sign that my early start had put me well ahead of others. The descent was manageable but tiring on my knees, and the final climb up hundreds of stairs to reach the village tested my legs. Along the way, horses blocked my path, and a pair of bulls with large horns rushed down the trail, prompting a quick leap onto a boulder. Heart racing, I continued to the top and finally found a welcoming place to stay with a view of the valley.",
          "I enjoyed my final night on the trail in that room, reconnecting with some people I had met at Basecamp and befriending a father-daughter pair from England. We shared dinner and stories, laughing over cultural differences and accents. Despite the comfort and company, there was a tinge of sadness knowing tomorrow I would leave the mountains behind and return to the busy streets of Pokhara.\n"
        ],
        "excerpt": "The final sunrise over Annapurna filled me with awe and a sense of closure. After a long day descending and climbing to Chomrong, I savored my last night in the mountains with new friends and a quiet view of the valley.",

Before leaving, I took a moment to enjoy the sunrise from my small private balcony, a quiet farewell to the mountains.",
          "The trail was nearly empty today, passing through small clusters of teahouses and bright green scenery. A few sections required walking on the road, but thankfully no vehicles appeared. The area was dotted with beautiful trees, making the final stretch feel calm and serene.",
          "I moved quickly, eager to reach my hostel and enjoy a long-awaited hot shower. The night before, I had booked a nicer hostel in Pokhara that also offered excursions such as paragliding, adding a touch of excitement to the end of the trip.",
          "The jeep station was simple, with shaded benches and cold drinks while waiting. My ride down the mountain was in two parts: the first on a bumpy dirt road where we paused briefly for a landslide to be cleared, and the second on smoother, paved roads after a transfer to a pre-paid taxi. The journey reminded me how rugged yet beautiful the Himalayas can be.",
          "As I settled back in Pokhara, I reflected on the journey. I met incredible people, witnessed breathtaking landscapes, and experienced moments of both challenge and awe, including a near-death scare. This trek will always remain one of my favorite adventures, and I hope someday to return for another unforgettable Himalayan experience, perhaps even the Everest Basecamp trek.\n"
        ],
        "excerpt": "The final day of my trek brought a quiet descent through lush greenery and the thrill of a bumpy jeep ride back to Pokhara. Reflecting on the journey, I realized it had been one of the most unforgettable experiences of my life.",

          "I first learned about 14'ers, the mountain peaks that rise above 14,000 feet, from someone I met while hiking the Tour du Mont Blanc in 2018. They mentioned that if I enjoyed hiking the high trails of the TMB, I would love Colorado, a place I had never considered visiting. It took nearly a year before I finally worked up the courage to take a solo trip to the United States and attempt to summit one of these towering peaks.",
          "After researching what to pack for the trail, where to stay, and how to manage transportation, I booked flights and reserved an Airbnb in Denver. Excitement mixed with nerves filled me as I prepared for the unknown. This trip was also a test of my body's endurance at high altitudes. I wanted to see how I would handle elevations above 10,000 feet, where Acute Mountain Sickness can make every step feel heavier than the last. Success on this hike was critical, as I had a planned trek in the Annapurna region just months away, where elevations rise above 18,000 feet.",
          "I chose Mt. Elbert as my first summit. Being the tallest peak in Colorado, I figured I might as well start big. The night before the hike, my anticipation kept me awake, and I barely got any sleep. I left Denver at 2:00 am, driving the empty highways to the trailhead while listening to an 80's retro station. The road was rough with potholes, but the rental car managed it without trouble.",
          "Arriving at the trailhead around 4:30 am, I was relieved to see other hikers preparing as well. The parking lot quickly filled, a testament to the trail's popularity. Once suited up, I started the ascent, immediately feeling the strain of the altitude. The forested trail lasted about two hours, and I had to stop frequently to catch my breath, though thankfully there were no signs of altitude sickness. I remained alert for bears, especially when I was alone in the dark, finding comfort whenever a distant headlamp appeared.",
          "Breaking above the treeline in time for sunrise was a magical reward. I paused to savor the moment and eat a protein bar before continuing. The climb ahead included multiple false summits, and each glimpse of the peak forced me to stop repeatedly to regulate my breathing. Finally, around 10:00 am, I reached the true summit. The 360-degree views were breathtaking, and the sense of accomplishment was overwhelming. I lingered for thirty minutes to eat lunch and soak in the scenery before starting my descent to avoid the predicted afternoon thunderstorms.",
          "The trail back through the trees felt longer and more exhausting than the ascent, with the rising heat making the forest feel stifling. After about four hours, I finally returned to the car. The drive back to Denver gave me a chance to reflect on the day, and a simple pasta dinner followed by collapsing into bed was the perfect ending to an unforgettable adventure.\n"

          "The morning after completing my first 14'er, I found myself waking up before dawn once again to tackle another peak. This one was known to be less strenuous than Mt. Elbert, but having conquered the tallest and most challenging of the \"easier\" 14'ers gave me confidence. I was still curious to see how my body would handle this fresh ascent.",
          "After a two-and-a-half-hour drive listening to my trusty 80's retro station, I parked along the roadside near the trailhead. There was no official parking lot, just a small space where a few other early hikers had already gathered. The trail began immediately at the edge of the road, and by 4:30 am I was setting out under the dim light of my headlamp.",
          "The trail wound through the woods in a series of switchbacks, many with stairs carved out of the rock. It made the climb more manageable, though my legs were still sore from the previous day's hike. Hikers were spaced evenly along the trail, allowing me to hike mostly solo while still feeling reassured by the distant glimmers of their headlamps.",
          "By 6:00 am, I emerged above the treeline just in time for a stunning sunrise. The trail from the trees to the summit was marked with large cairns, which added a fun element for photographs. Most of the path consisted of rock-cut stairs, spaced like regular steps, which made the pace predictable. Along the way, I spotted small chirping Pikas scurrying among the rocks, a delightful reminder of the wildlife thriving at these elevations.",
          "The ridge leading to the summit shifted from stairs to a scree-filled path, with occasional snow patches along the sides. Despite this, I reached the summit by 8:00 am, nearly two hours faster than my Mt. Elbert climb. At the top, I enjoyed the views, snapped photos, and even chatted with fellow hikers, who offered a free beer and good company. Descending with another hiker helped me maintain a steady pace over the well-maintained trail. My knees held up thanks to my braces, and by 1:00 pm I was back at the car, tired but elated.",
          "This hike was a perfect contrast to my first 14'er: easier, social, and immensely rewarding. The combination of a manageable trail, friendly fellow hikers, and even a free beer made it one of the most positive experiences of the trip. I left knowing I would be returning next year to explore even more of Colorado's majestic peaks.\n"
        ],
        "excerpt": "The second 14'er of my Colorado trip was easier but just as rewarding, with a stunning sunrise and playful Pikas along the trail. Reaching the summit quickly allowed me to enjoy new friendships, breathtaking views, and even a free beer at the top.",

          "For my second year hiking Colorado's 14'ers, I decided to camp near the trailheads. This way, I could wake up at 4:00 am instead of 1:00 am and drive three hours. Just ten minutes to the start felt like a luxury after last year's early mornings.",
          "My first peak of the trip was La Plata Peak, named after the area's numerous silver mines. The trail wasn't particularly long, but it was technically more challenging than the hikes I completed the previous year. The trails are classified from 1 to 5, with 1 being the easiest. Mt. Elbert and the second 14'er I climbed last year were 1's, while La Plata rated as a 2.",
          "I set up a wild camp about a mile and a half from the trailhead. I was completely alone, surrounded by silence except for the sound of a nearby river. Sleeping on a slight incline made the night restless, but I woke around 3:30 am, packed up, and drove the short distance to the trailhead. I cooked a quick breakfast in the trunk of my rental SUV, noticing about ten other cars but few hikers on the trail.",
          "The climb started with two hours through thick forest before opening to a rocky wall crisscrossed with switchbacks. I didn't try to reach the sunrise point, but the morning light painted the surrounding peaks pink, making them look snow-covered even in early September. Emerging above the trees, I could see neighboring peaks and began hiking a saddle ridge toward the summit, spotting strange alpine plants and hidden patches of snow. Far below, a small mountain lake shimmered, a beautiful contrast against the rocky landscape.",
          "I reached the summit around noon after about six hours on the trail. It was more crowded than I expected, with hikers whose cars I had seen in the parking lot. I lingered briefly to eat and take photos, but like on Mt. Elbert, social interaction was limited, so I headed back down. The descent took longer than planned when I ran out of water for nearly two hours before reaching a river. Luckily, I realized I had my filter the whole time and could safely drink. I ended the day with a fresh change of clothes, a quick stop at a larger river to refill, and a restful night at a last-minute campground.",
          "Camping close to the trailhead made this experience feel more relaxed than my previous Colorado hikes. Despite the technical challenges of La Plata Peak, the combination of solitude, alpine scenery, and personal accomplishment made it a memorable adventure. I left the mountains feeling energized and ready for the next peak.\n"

          "For the second hike of my Colorado trip, I chose an easier summit, Mt. Bierstadt, and planned a later start at 6:00 am since I had to drive about an hour from my campground. This class 1 route involved some scrambling over boulders near the summit, but nothing too challenging. One of the most striking features of this 14'er was the massive paved parking lot, which was already overflowing by the time I arrived.",
          "The trail was crowded, but that's to be expected for a peak so close to a major city with easy access. The first hour of the hike was pleasantly flat, winding through prairies dotted with bushes, small lakes, and streams. A boardwalk at the start made crossing streams simple while protecting the local vegetation. I loved this section and paused often to take photos of the idyllic landscape.",
          "Once I reached the base of the mountain, the trail turned into switchbacks leading to the boulder-strewn top. With total elevation gain in the 2,000-foot range, I reached the summit by 10:30 am. It was a surprisingly quick and easy climb compared to some of the other peaks I had tackled.",
          "At the top, I met a few fellow hikers and enjoyed the views, though the summit quickly filled with more people arriving. The descent required minor scrambling and some wayfinding, but following other hikers made it straightforward. The trail was fast and easy, a relief as the temperature started rising.",
          "Mt. Bierstadt offered a very different experience from my other hikes. The combination of open prairie, alpine lakes, boulder scrambling, and wide-open skies made it a beautiful and accessible day hike. I left feeling refreshed and grateful for the simpler side of Colorado's 14'er adventures.\n"

          "For my final 14'er of this Colorado trip, I chose Grays Peak, a popular summit that begins above the treeline. This meant skipping the two-hour forest slog I had endured on previous hikes, which was a welcome change. I also hoped this peak would provide an opportunity to meet fellow hikers and campers along the way.",
          "The night before, I met two women camping nearby in hammocks. We shared dinner and conversation, and although our paths would briefly cross again near the summit, this was the only time we connected. After three consecutive days of hiking, I was exhausted, so I opted to climb only Grays instead of combining it with Torreys as part of the common saddle route.",
          "I started the trail around 4:30 am. The initial section followed a gently ascending valley along a river, which I could fully appreciate only on the way back down. The high starting altitude meant I was already quite elevated after a short hike. Pausing at just the right moment, I watched a red sun rise over the distant ridges, a sight that remains one of my favorite memories. The trail gradually became busier as more hikers began their climbs.",
          "About two and a half hours in, the trail steepened toward the summit, forcing frequent breaks as my heart adjusted to the high altitude. The pink light of the sunrise bathed the landscape in a magical glow, making every pause worthwhile. By 8:30 am, I reached the summit and was rewarded with breathtaking 360-degree views. High winds prompted me to huddle behind a rock wall with some new friends, giving us a chance to admire the trail I had just conquered from above.",
          "The descent was a joy as the sunlight brought out the greens of the alpine vegetation. By noon, I returned to my car and headed to a nearby campground, reflecting on an unforgettable long weekend of hikes. Grays Peak offered the perfect combination of challenging altitude, scenic views, and the unique pleasure of hiking entirely above the trees.\n"
        ],
        "excerpt": "Grays Peak was a stunning finale to my Colorado 14'er trip, with the entire hike starting above the treeline. The sunrise, 360-degree summit views, and alpine landscapes made it a magical way to end the weekend.",

          "This year, my partner joined me for my new September tradition of hiking Colorado 14'ers, turning it into a bigger adventure since she had family in the state. After spending a week visiting them, we headed into the mountains to tackle our first peak together: Mt. Shavano. It was a Class 2 trail with significant elevation gain of around 4,500 feet, making it challenging but manageable.",
          "We camped at the trailhead in my small Duplex Zpacks tent. Technically designed for two, it felt cramped with our air mattresses, which meant a restless night and little sleep. Despite that, we were eager to get going and hit the trail by 5:00 am. The early stretch was flat, sharing some trail with the Colorado Trail, before ascending over rocks and tree roots. Small water sources dotted the way, though we didn't stop to refill, which would later prove a mistake.",
          "After two and a half hours, we emerged above the trees and paused to take in the stunning views. Since this was my partner's first time above 9,000 feet, we proceeded slowly, watching for any signs of altitude sickness and taking frequent breaks. The ascent beyond the treeline took longer than usual, partly due to COVID-related fitness setbacks and the need to acclimatize. We saw maybe three other hikers all day, which made the experience feel very solitary.",
          "As we approached the col between peaks, we began the final push toward the summit. About halfway up, we stopped to snack and catch our breath. A hiker descending warned us that the summit views weren't worth the tricky conditions, and with our water nearly gone, we decided to turn back. The descent was exhausting. The sun beat down, and our dehydration made each step feel heavier than the last. Nearly three hours later, we stumbled across the smallest trickle of water between rocks. The relief of rehydrating after hours without water was indescribable.",
          "Once back at the car, we reflected on the day. Mt. Shavano had been the toughest and longest 14'er we'd done to date. The lack of water on the trail and the tricky summit conditions turned it into a serious challenge, but it was also a memorable adventure. We left grateful for our safety, our perseverance, and the experience of tackling the mountain together.\n"

          "After our challenging experience on Mt. Shavano, we made sure to carry as much water as possible for our attempt at the DeCaLiBro-n combination route two days later. This route connects four 14,000-foot peaks: Democrat, Cameron, Lincoln, and Bross via ridges, making it theoretically doable in a single day. We skipped Bross since it's on private land, sticking with the first three summits instead.",
          "The trailhead at Kite Lake starts at 12,000 feet, which made the 2,000 feet of elevation gain to the first peak feel easier. We spent the night in the car to acclimate, knowing that starting at high altitude without preparation can be tough. A pink sunrise greeted us as we set out at 7:00 am. The trail began gently, then climbed via switchbacks toward the col at the base of the first peak.",
          "Old mining remnants dotted the landscape, including rusted metal and collapsed mine entrances, adding a touch of history to the hike. The absence of trees allowed panoramic views at every turn. Kite Lake below looked exactly like a kite, a reminder of just how far we could see and how far we still had to go.",
          "We reached Democrat first, summiting in under an hour from the col. After a brief rest and photos, we crossed loose rock to reach Cameron about 1.5 hours later. Its dome shape made the next stretch toward Lincoln a gentle slope. Lincoln required minor scrambling near the top, with a long flat section in the middle between peaks. By 12:30 pm, we had completed all three summits, able to see nearly the entire trail from Lincoln. Looking back, Cameron appeared as a floating rocky island in the sky, a surreal perspective.",
          "The descent followed the same route, back over Cameron and Democrat to Kite Lake. We practically raced down, exhilarated and exhausted from completing such an epic route. Compared to Mt. Shavano, this hike felt smoother and more rewarding. Finishing the DeCaLiBro-n combination left us with a huge sense of accomplishment and memories of a truly spectacular alpine day.\n"

          "Returning to Colorado for my fourth year in a row, I decided to start the trip with Mt. Belford, a peak with 4,500 feet of elevation gain over just four miles. The steepness promised a tough day, and it quickly became clear this would be one of the most physically demanding peaks I'd tackled solo, even compared to my first summit on Mt. Elbert.",
          "I arrived at the parking lot around 6:00 am and was greeted by empty spaces, with only a few other hikers beginning their day. The trail started immediately steep, climbing roughly 1,000 feet per mile. I stopped often in the early stretch to catch my breath, winding through thick forests punctuated by stream crossings with bridges made from fallen logs. Grassy clearings appeared here and there, providing a chance to pause and look ahead at the trail. The ruins of an old cabin added a little intrigue to the route.",
          "After two and a half hours, I emerged above the treeline, walking through a valley shaded by the surrounding mountains. The trail eased for a while, allowing me to regain my stamina and enjoy the views of the peaks around me. Eventually, it was time to start ascending the valley's sides, and four hours in, I finally gained a vantage point over other mountains in the distance. The deep blue sky and scattered white clouds made the long effort feel worth it.",
          "Five hours into the hike, I reached the ridge with the summit in sight. Forty-five minutes later, I arrived at the top. A few other hikers passed by, continuing along a combination route, but I focused on just the single peak. The wind and chill at the summit were sharp, yet the exhilaration of reaching the USGS elevation marker made all the effort worthwhile.",
          "The descent was just as challenging. I slipped on loose scree early on, earning a few cuts and scrapes, but nothing serious. Dark clouds loomed in the distance, so I kept moving steadily, avoiding photos and distractions. After three and a half hours, I returned to the car exhausted but relieved. Mt. Belford was a brutal day-one peak, but it set the tone for the rest of the trip and reminded me why Colorado's 14'ers are so unforgettable.\n"

        "excerpt": "Mt. Belford was a tough introduction to this year's Colorado 14'ers, with steep climbs and long stretches above the treeline. Despite scrapes and exhaustion, reaching the summit left me exhilarated and ready for the adventures ahead.",

          "Mount Massive, the second-highest summit in Colorado, is just a few feet shy of Mount Elbert and ranks as the third-highest peak in the contiguous United States. Located in the San Isabel National Forest near Leadville, it offers a mix of grassy slopes, rocky ridges, and sweeping views of the surrounding Rockies. I had been anticipating this hike for a while, knowing the trail would challenge both endurance and focus.",
          "The beginning of the trail is deceptively easy, tempting hikers to move quickly, but summiting a 14'er is more like running a marathon than a sprint. I had a small navigational hiccup early on, with a misleading marker forcing me to bushwhack briefly before rejoining the correct path. Once back on track, I moved steadily, reaching the treeline after roughly two hours.",
          "Crossing over grassy slopes, the trail gradually climbed into switchbacks that gained elevation quickly. Eventually, the path transitioned into a rocky approach, requiring careful footing as the rocks grew larger and more frequent. By the four-hour mark, I reached the steeper section leading to the summit. Some parts were tricky, with steep drop-offs and the need for frequent breaks to catch my breath.",
          "From this vantage point, Mount Elbert was visible in the distance, a reminder of the peaks that define Colorado. The final stretch to the summit followed a cold, windy, mile-long ridge. Reaching the top brought a mix of exhilaration and relief, a reward for the hours of steady ascent.",
          "Descending was much easier than climbing. The way back felt clearer, especially across the rocky sections, though the treeline seemed to stretch forever on the way down. Eventually, I returned to the parking lot, tired but satisfied, with another incredible 14'er checked off the list.\n"
        ],
        "excerpt": "Mount Massive challenged me with rocky ridges, windy summits, and steep switchbacks, but the views made every step worth it. Reaching the top and looking out toward Mount Elbert was an unforgettable Colorado moment.",

      "In Northern Italy there is a mountain range known as the Dolomites, and they contain a series of seven trails collectively known as the Alta Via. This is a thru-hike of one of those trails: the Alta Via 1. Winding its way over 65 miles from North to South, this high route reached a maximum altitude of 9,129 feet and took 10 days to complete, while passing through a panorama of jagged ridges, vertical walls, and majestic towers, culminating in some of the most beautiful landscapes in the world."

          "My friend Cerstin and I caught an early morning shuttle bus from the town where we were staying to Lago Brais, the official starting point of the Alta Via 1. The bus was packed with hikers and their backpacks, so we stood for the ride, eagerly watching the landscape pass by. We were dropped off in front of a hotel at the lake, and it felt like the perfect place to begin our adventure.",
          "Lago Brais is stunning, a turquoise mountain lake nestled at the foot of white-gray peaks. A small dock jutted into the water, lined with old wooden canoes tied up neatly, and a tiny shack sat at the end. We explored the edges of the lake, but it was too vast to circle entirely, and the mountains called us onward.",
          "The trail followed the lake for a while on mostly level ground, giving us a gentle start before the real ascent began. Soon we turned away from the lake and started climbing, stepping carefully over loose rocks. The incline steadily increased, and before long we were stopping frequently to catch our breath. Each glance back offered a shrinking view of the lake, a reminder of how far we had already climbed.",
          "As we gained elevation, the views opened up dramatically. Rolling hills of jagged rock formations stretched into the distance, shaped by tectonic forces into strange and striking angles. Some peaks appeared as if someone had sliced the tops off, while others jutted sharply into the sky. Hiking through this surreal landscape was mesmerizing, and it felt like walking among giant sculptures made by nature itself.",
          "After an hour and a half of traversing the ridges, we caught our first glimpse of Rifugio Bella, the tiny mountain refuge where we would spend the night. Before heading down, we decided to take a side trek up a nearby peak. Ninety minutes later, we reached the summit, and the view was incredible. From up there, Lago Brais was far below, a small jewel in the mountains, and the vertical distance we had climbed felt truly impressive.",
          "We eventually descended to Rifugio Bella, where spacious beds and a hearty dinner awaited us. After eating, we spent the evening talking and drinking with new friends, watching the sun set over the peaks. The sky turned a deep purple as the temperature dropped, and a little fox scampered by, adding to the magic of the mountains. It was the perfect start to our trek, and I couldn't imagine being anywhere else.\n"

          "Breakfast on the Alta Via 1 was a treat compared to most trekking mornings. Instead of the usual sparse bread and jam, there were eggs and hearty options to fuel the day ahead. Refreshed and well-fed, we left Rifugio Bella and stepped back into the rolling, open terrain of the Dolomites, surrounded by a variety of striking geologic formations. The views felt even more dramatic than the first day, with every turn revealing a new ridge, peak, or rocky outcrop.",
          "The trail took us over grassy hills toward distant mountains, and about seventy minutes in we entered dense pine forests. The smooth rolling terrain gave way to a steep descent, with wooden railings guarding the cliff edges. We carefully made our way down the side of the mountain, following switchbacks into a valley below, where the landscape opened into a peaceful, sunlit refuge.",
          "At the valley floor, a small rifugio appeared, inviting us to rest, eat, and enjoy a second breakfast. After a short break, we pushed on, climbing back up into a new section of the mountains. The trail here was sandy underfoot, possibly an old lakebed or a natural deposit, with switchbacks that made the ascent feel longer, especially after the large meal we had enjoyed.",
          "As we pressed onward, the trail led us past a river running beside a small farmhouse. With no livestock around, we kicked off our shoes and let the icy water wash over our feet, a refreshing and exhilarating pause in the hike. The surrounding mountains, partly cloudy skies, and flowing water made the stop feel like a hidden gem tucked away in the Dolomites.",
          "By evening, we arrived at Rifugio Lavarella, nestled beside a serene lake with cows grazing nearby. The rifugio had an inviting atmosphere with watery features scattered across the property, and the dinner was another highlight of the trek. We relaxed on the patio, watching clouds drift across the sky, chatting with fellow hikers, and even sneaking in some naps. It was a perfect mix of activity and tranquility, showcasing the Alta Via 1 at its best.\n"

        "excerpt": "Day two of the Alta Via 1 treated us to dense pine forests, dramatic descents, and a hidden valley with a peaceful rifugio. The evening ended at Rifugio Lavarella, where cows grazed by a serene lake and the dinner was unforgettable.",

          "Breakfast at the rifugio set the tone for another beautiful day on the Alta Via 1. I took a final stroll around the grounds before packing up, enjoying the overcast sky that still allowed bright sunlight to filter through. The trail led us away from the lake and into the woods, quickly gaining elevation until we emerged above the trees. From there, rolling green hills dotted with rocks stretched as far as the eye could see, and the beginnings of a cloud inversion added a magical touch to the landscape.",
          "Our group of six kept a steady pace through the morning. Alongside my friend Cerstin were two mother-daughter pairs from the States. While most of us moved together, one of the mother-daughter duos picked up the pace during a steep ascent, leaving the rest of us to enjoy the scenery at a slightly slower tempo. The trail passed lakes, empty cattle pens, and rivers while winding around massive boulders. We even discovered a cave in the rock face, though it proved unremarkable.",
          "As the day progressed, we reached the edge of a forested valley flanked by massive walls of rock. Before descending, we had to climb up the left side of the valley, huffing and puffing for about an hour until snow patches came into view. At the top, the trail stretched out below us in steep switchbacks that led toward a lake. From our vantage point, the view was spectacular, revealing the path we would follow the next day.",
          "The descent brought us closer to the lake, where a true wall of rock dominated the landscape. We took a well-deserved break to dip our feet in the water and snap photos, sharing the space with a lively group of schoolchildren on a field trip. Nearby stone ruins added a touch of history, and the trail led past a wide river that offered fresh water before we finally approached Rifugio Scotoni. World War II barracks and old ammunition depots stood as silent reminders of the past, contrasting with the natural beauty around us.",
          "Rifugio Scotoni proved to be a cozy and welcoming stop, with comfortable rooms, a view of the surrounding valley, and a patio perfect for dinner. Clouds and rain rolled in during the late afternoon, giving everyone a reason to relax and nap. As night fell, we enjoyed beers on the patio while watching the stars emerge above the mountains, a perfect end to a day filled with breathtaking scenery and memorable experiences.\n"
        ],
        "excerpt": "We hiked above forests and rolling hills before descending through a forested valley to a serene lake, pausing to explore stone ruins along the way. The day ended at Rifugio Scotoni, where we enjoyed dinner on the patio and watched stars fill the night sky.",

          "Our day began with an immediate climb out of the valley, right past the World War II ruins we had passed yesterday. The ascent took about an hour and a half, and by the time we reached the top, we were walking on patches of snow. The trail offered a little bit of everything, from snowy slopes to colorful mountainsides, and the views only improved as we gained elevation.",
          "After leaving the snow behind, we rounded a bend along a mountainside covered in red-brown rock and dirt, with anti-avalanche fencing scattered along the slope. Beyond the bend, the landscape transitioned to white stone and green grasses, creating a striking contrast against the mountains. At a junction, our group initially took a wrong turn, but it turned into a memorable detour past a massive boulder and a distant valley, before we returned to the correct path along a narrow strip around a dome-shaped mountain.",
          "Along the way, we encountered more ruins and caves, while the distant mountains presented curious shapes, including one that looked as if its top had been chopped off. White and gray rocks slowly gave way to green fields as we tackled a series of moderate switchbacks. Thick conifer forests marked the end of the ascent, and the trail eventually led us to a restaurant nestled among the trees, with a patio overlooking the forest canopy.",
          "The food stops on this trek continue to impress, thanks to the accessibility of the rifugios. At the restaurant, I enjoyed a beer, a salad, and a burger with fries topped with a fried egg. While it may compromise the feeling of remoteness, having access to full kitchens means hearty meals that energize hikers for the next leg of the journey.",
          "The final portion of the day led us through more forests with occasional glimpses of surrounding mountains and a few road crossings. We ended the day ascending to Rifugio Averu, perched atop a rocky slope with a steep drop-off. The views from the dining hall were incredible, and the meals were some of the best on the trek, complete with hardboiled eggs for breakfast. By the end of the day, it was clear that the trek was not only visually stunning but also wonderfully satisfying for the appetite.\n"

        "excerpt": "We climbed out of the valley, passing snowy slopes and colorful mountainsides before navigating narrow trails and switchbacks through forests. Our day ended at Rifugio Averu, where spectacular views and delicious meals made the effort more than worth it.",

          "Today's hike was a feast for the eyes, with landscapes that felt almost otherworldly. We started the morning under a full moon, enjoying breakfast in the cozy dining room of Rifugio Averu before setting out. The trail required a bit of backtracking, which allowed us to avoid via ferrata ladders that would have demanded helmets and nerves of steel due to the sheer drop-offs.",
          "Once back on the main trail, the Dolomites revealed their extraordinary beauty. I kept stealing glances behind me, knowing I might otherwise miss something spectacular. Massive boulders seemed to float in the clouds, and one rock formation looked like a throne fit for the gods, perched dramatically on a cliffside.",
          "The trail itself was a constant rhythm of ups and downs. Along the way, we passed larger groups of hikers heading in the opposite direction, which made for a lot of stop-and-go. A few busy roads also interrupted the flow of the trail, but they were a minor inconvenience compared with the incredible scenery surrounding us.",
          "After leaving the larger groups behind, it was just backpackers and the mountains. The geological formations were unlike anything I had ever seen: curved mountains pushed onto their sides, jagged peaks cut off by clouds, and ruins seemingly hovering on the edge of cliffs. Endless stretches of green filled the valleys and hillsides, making every step feel like a journey through another world.",
          "By the end of the day, the trail had left a lasting impression. The combination of unique rock formations, verdant valleys, and cloud-kissed peaks made this section of the Dolomites feel completely magical. It was the kind of hike that reminds you why you come to the mountains: to be inspired, awed, and completely immersed in the natural world.\n"

          "Today's hike began in a lush pine forest, with sections of the trail strewn with large rocks that made for some fun leap-frogging along the way. The forest was quiet and green, but not particularly dramatic in terms of views or elevation. Once we left the trees and the road behind, the scenery opened up, revealing rolling landscapes and our first real look at the ridge ahead, where old World War II anti-aircraft guns stood as silent monuments.",
          "As we continued, we realized an ultra marathon was taking place in the area. Trails crisscrossed the green hills, and we had to carefully navigate switchbacks while runners and walkers sped past or made their way up the mountain. It was remarkable to watch so many participants leap from rock to rock without a single misstep.",
          "At the top of the mountain, we came across a small hut with a cable system for transporting supplies where we stopped briefly for a drink before beginning the descent, encountering marathoners making their way up the other side. The trail led to a lake at the bottom, but the sandy shore offered little comfort, so we moved on around the lake, greeted by a sheer wall of stone that rose dramatically as we crested a small hill.",
          "Rain clouds were beginning to gather, so we quickened our pace along the rocky terrain, though the drizzle was light and never slowed us down. Eventually, we began our final ascent to Rifugio Tissi, perched on the edge of a cliff. From this vantage point, we could see a town nestled beside a lake below, with towering mountains rising on one side and a sheer drop-off on the other.",
          "After settling in, we watched the sun set from the cliff overhang, the sky painting the mountains in brilliant hues. We lingered as darkness fell, stargazing until the heavens revealed Jupiter shining brightly above. It was a magical end to a day of hiking, offering both breathtaking vistas and peaceful moments under the stars.\n"
        ],
        "excerpt": "We spent the day navigating lush forests, rocky trails, and marathon runners, all while ascending to a ridge with epic views. The evening ended at Rifugio Tissi, perched on a cliff, where we watched the sun set and Jupiter rise above the mountains.",

          "Our day began with a descent from Rifugio Tissi, retracing part of yesterday's path before heading off in a new direction. We walked briefly along a ridge I've dubbed \"The Wall,\" then entered a small cluster of pine trees before emerging into a cleared valley. Up ahead, a herd of cows ambled lazily through the landscape. Unlike my last encounter with cattle, these cows were completely indifferent to our presence, and we shared the trail with them for a short while before a wire fence marked their boundary.",
          "The trail led us into another pine forest tucked between dramatic mountain spires that resembled chimney stacks. A waterfall turned into a river in the distance, though we crossed over the top rather than below it, missing a few photo opportunities. It took about an hour to navigate the forested section, after which the trail began a steady ascent toward the rocky mountain faces. Snow lingered in the shadows, clinging stubbornly to hidden nooks.",
          "As the trail curved around the mountainside, we passed through a narrow gap that felt straight out of a fantasy film. Here, we met a fellow hiker from Germany tackling a much longer trek through the Alps and Dolomites, whose path overlapped with the Alta Via 1. This brief encounter added a sense of camaraderie to our journey and highlighted the shared experiences of those drawn to these mountains.",
          "After the bend, it was time to begin the descent. The path wound through a deciduous forest scattered with stumps, rocks, and wooden benches for resting. I paused for a break, and a butterfly settled on my backpack, offering a peaceful moment before the rest of the group caught up. The forested descent felt calming and rejuvenating after the climbs and narrow passes of the morning.",
          "Finally, we arrived at Rifugio Carestiato, perched atop a rocky outcrop overlooking a lush valley. Clouds drifted past the distant mountains, and the presence of the forest around the rifugio made for a serene atmosphere. The evening was spent relaxing, playing cards, and enjoying dinner together, a quiet and well-earned conclusion to a day filled with dramatic landscapes and shared moments in the mountains.\n"

        "excerpt": "We spent the day navigating ridges, pine forests, and hidden snow patches while sharing the trail with indifferent cows. The evening ended at Rifugio Carestiato, perched on a rocky outcrop with sweeping valley views and a calm, relaxing atmosphere.",

          "Waking up early this morning was a rare treat, as I was able to catch the sunrise filtering through the trees. The soft morning light made the trail feel almost magical, and it set the tone for the day ahead. The route offered a mix of forests, mountain passes, and what appeared to be old stone military barracks scattered along the landscape.",
          "We began our hike through grassy fields before entering the trees once again. There were brief stretches on a road during a descent, but we quickly returned to the forest. Hidden among the pines were some fascinating ruins, hinting at a long history that added an extra layer of intrigue to the trek.",
          "Eventually, the trail emerged onto exposed scree fields, where the sun beat down with little relief from clouds or shade. The views from this open section were spectacular, offering distant mountain panoramas in every direction. After navigating across the scree and small groves of pine, we came upon a grassy clearing with an old hut and a still-functioning water trough. We refilled our bottles and pressed on, eager to continue exploring.",
          "Later in the day, we came across large stone ruins tucked among thick vegetation. They were too substantial to have been ordinary homes, so I suspect they were remnants of World War II. The trail then led us to a crest with sweeping views before narrowing into a dense forest of pine and bushes. The heat and strong scent of the pines made me push forward quickly, motivated by the sight of Rifugio Pramperet in the distance.",
          "Rifugio Pramperet provided a welcome respite with a courtyard, dormitories along one wall, and tables with umbrellas for outdoor meals. Dinner was, as always on this trek, fantastic. Afterwards a moose arrived! It stayed at a respectful distance, but watching it as the sun set behind the mountains was a perfect end to a day filled with striking scenery and hidden history.\n"
        ],
        "excerpt": "The trail took us through forests, scree fields, and World War II ruins, with distant mountains framing every turn. Rifugio Pramperet offered a relaxing stop, capped off by a sunset and a moose sighting.",

          "Today's hike was all about climbing. We started early, knowing it would be a short day, since our destination was Rifugio Pian de Fontana, the last stop on our trek. After a brief descent, we immediately began ascending toward the cols between mountain peaks. The stone here was a striking white, dotted with dark green vegetation, and the climb demanded frequent breaks to catch our breath. Despite the effort, it was refreshing to be above the forest once again, surrounded by wide-open vistas.",
          "As we gained altitude, we passed patches of ice and were treated to endless views of the surrounding mountains, some wreathed in clouds. At times, it truly felt like standing on the edge of the world. After about an hour and a half of steady climbing, we reached the top and paused to take it all in. The mountains seemed endless in every direction, and the solitude was invigorating.",
          "The trail then led us down between two peaks that appeared split by lightning, opening a natural corridor for our path. A massive wall of rock rose on our left, and distant wildlife, possibly deer or moose, added to the scene. Marmots scurried across grassy fields dotted with dandelions, keeping us company as we made our way through the alpine terrain. Clouds rolled in briefly, only to clear again and reveal the trail ahead.",
          "A challenging set of switchbacks guided us down to our final destination for the night. Rumors of Edelweiss along the switchbacks sparked some excitement, though neither I nor my friend Cerstin spotted any, which was a minor disappointment. Once at Rifugio Pian de Fontana, we were greeted by a herd of sheep that lingered for much of the afternoon before wandering off just before dinner.",
          "The evening was a perfect celebration of the trek's end. We shared a plentiful dinner, plenty of wine, and laughter with our fellow hikers. As night fell, the sky turned brilliant shades of pink and purple, marking the close of an incredible journey. Tomorrow would be all downhill as we aimed to reach the bus stop and reconnect with a friend waiting in town, but tonight was about savoring the final moments on the trail.\n"
        ],
        "excerpt": "The final day of the trek was full of climbing, sweeping alpine views, and marmots for company. Rifugio Pian de Fontana welcomed us with sheep, wine, and a brilliant sunset to mark the end of the journey.",

          "The final day on trail was mostly downhill, and we started early to ensure we had plenty of time to catch the bus back into town. From the rifugio, the path initially stretched laterally across the mountains before beginning a steady descent. I paused to take one last look back at the area, and the scenery felt like something out of a dream, with mossy slopes, rolling peaks, and clouds drifting lazily over the valleys.",
          "I kept an eye out for Edelweiss, a flower I had hoped to spot along this part of the trail, but it remained elusive. The terrain transitioned from open, grassy mountainsides to dense forests as we began zig-zagging down steep switchbacks. Along the way, we stopped at a small rifugio with an open kitchen and bathrooms, snacking on leftover pie before continuing downward.",
          "The valley below widened as we descended, giving us breathtaking views both up the mountains we had traversed and down to the river below. It was a chance to reflect on the journey, and the scale of the surrounding landscape made all the effort feel worth it. On the trail, I spoke with other hikers who had experience on the GR20 in Corsica. Their encouragement gave me confidence that if I could complete the Alta Via 1, I could handle other challenging European trails as well.",
          "We reached the end of the hike around 11 a.m. The finish was unceremonious, just a bus stop along a road. Behind it, though, a wide rocky river offered a perfect moment to celebrate. We kicked off our shoes, dipped our feet in the icy water, and laughed as we nearly slipped into the flowing current. It was a simple, joyful way to mark the end of the journey.",
          "Eventually, it was time to regroup, repack, and board the bus back to civilization. The ride was full, giving us time to reflect on an incredible trek. Between the amazing views, fantastic food, well-maintained trails, and great company, this adventure exceeded all expectations. I left thinking about the Alta Via 2, knowing it might be a future journey worth taking.\n"

        "excerpt": "The final day of the Alta Via 1 was filled with steep switchbacks, wide valleys, and dream-like views across the mountains. We ended at a riverside bus stop, dipping our feet in the cold water before heading back to civilization.",

      "Encircling the Mont Blanc mountain in the European Alps, the tour of this peak is a classic long-distance hike covering a distance of 106 miles while passing through France, Italy, and Switzerland. It offered a challenging experience filled with diverse landscapes, a unique blend of cultures, and stunning alpine charm across 12 days of hiking, all while sleeping in comfy mountain huts and eating warm home-cooked meals each night. The unofficially highest point on the trek, via an alternate route, was 9,010 feet."

          "I've hiked before in the Andes while doing the Torres del Paine in Patagonia and San Jose de Maipo outside Santiago, Chile, both climbs of around 600 meters. But nothing prepared me for hiking into, up, and over mountains. My second trip to France brought me to Les Houches, a quaint village perched above a valley. Arriving late the night before, I was immediately thrust back into backpacking mode, and dinner at a local auberge set the tone for what lay ahead. Seated with a table of mostly French-speaking hikers, I felt an instant camaraderie; we were all here for the same reason: the Tour du Mont Blanc.",
          "The Tour du Mont Blanc is no small feat: 170 kilometers circling the Mont Blanc massif, with roughly 10,000 meters of elevation gain and loss, weaving through France, Italy, and Switzerland, and nights spent in mountain huts and refuges. A chilly morning greeted me with cloud-covered views of Les Houches, and I quickly realized I was headed the wrong way. Momentarily embarrassed I started ascending earthen steps into the hillside. Clouds lingered for an hour, casting a magical veil over my first encounter with this legendary trail. Gravel paths, wooden steps, and paved roads carried me higher until Col de Voza offered the first sweeping view back down into the valley.",
          "The alternate route I had chosen led through dense forests and rocky scrambles, complete with steel cables bolted into sheer rock faces. Signs warned of \"dangerous\" paths, and I welcomed the challenge. Waterfalls and rushing rivers punctuated the trail, with slick rocks forcing cautious crossings. The ascent to Col de Tricot tested my limits: thin air made each breath labored, my stomach protested, and nausea set in. But reaching 2,120 meters above sea level rewarded every struggle with a panorama that stretched farther than I could take in at once.",
          "The descent was grueling on my knees, lingering reminders of the Camino three months prior. By the time I reached Chalets de Miage, it was already 2 p.m., and I still had more climbing ahead before reaching my refuge for the night, Auberge de Truc. The auberge was a true mountain hideaway: no lights in the dorm, outhouse bathrooms, and milk straight from their cows. And yet, none of it mattered. I had done it. I had climbed, scrambled, and crossed rivers. I had made it through my first day in the high mountains.",
          "Dinner brought new friendships: a couple from Germany, a man from South Korea, and a woman from Spain. Afterward, we watched the sun paint Dome de Miage in brilliant pinks and oranges. Life in the mountains is quiet, almost sacred. Even the cowbells, which might annoy elsewhere, were soothing here, lulling me to sleep as I dreamt of the next stage of the Tour du Mont Blanc.\n"
        ],
        "excerpt": "My first day on the Tour du Mont Blanc pushed me to the limits of endurance: rocky scrambles, river crossings, and thin mountain air. But standing at 2,120 meters above sea level, the sweeping views, mountain peace, and new friendships made every step unforgettable.",

          "Day two of the Tour du Mont Blanc pushed me to heights I'd never reached before. The hike up to Col de la Croix was brutal, and the pictures I'd taken didn't even capture the steepness of the trail. Today was a mix of walking, scrambling, and pulling myself over rocks and boulders, testing every bit of strength and endurance I had. The day began with a descent of 750 meters into Les Contamines, winding through twisting roads and trails. I even got lost twice trying to find the town center, but the charming streets and quaint architecture made the detours worth it.",
          "Leaving the city, the trail followed a shallow path along a river through a forest, dotted with waterfalls and one strikingly deep blue river cutting through its own canyon. The hike steadily became steeper, passing cows, red-roofed chalets, and old stone buildings that reminded me of Torres del Paine in Patagonia. Refuge Nant Borrant provided a short breather before the next push, while Refuge de la Balme marked the beginning of the steep climb to Col du Bonhomme. Pausing to turn back and admire the trail behind me helped put the day's struggle into perspective, as every step revealed breathtaking views.",
          "The final leg to Col de la Croix was intense: narrow paths, boulders, and sheer drop-offs demanded every ounce of energy I had left. By the time I reached the refuge, the clouds were rolling in, reducing visibility to almost zero. The mountain refuge was a true high-altitude hideaway: solar-powered, with limited lighting, cold showers, and dorm-style sleeping. Candlelight and headlamps lit the evening as I joined fellow hikers from Israel, the UK, Canada, Brazil, and Ireland for dinner. Conversation and shared stories softened the hardships of the day.",
          "The sunset was a magical reward, painting a distant mountain in soft purples and the sky in vivid oranges. Despite the physical toll, the serenity of the high mountains was intoxicating. French bread may have been dry, the showers cold, and my legs sore beyond belief but every challenge was part of the adventure. Tomorrow promised even greater elevation gains, and I knew I would need all my energy for what was ahead.",
          "Mountain sleeping, cold showers, and long climbs are hard, but moments like this, where the world spreads out beneath you in clouds and ligh, —make it all absolutely worth it.\n"
        ],
        "excerpt": "Day two of the Tour du Mont Blanc was a test of strength and will: boulder-strewn trails, steep switchbacks, and stunning high-mountain vistas. By the time I reached Col de la Croix, clouds and candlelight at the refuge made every exhausting step feel unforgettable.",

          "Reaching the top of the Tour du Mont Blanc highpoints is a surreal experience. At the Col des Fours, 2,665 meters above sea level, nothing but mountains surrounded us. The pedestal marking the highest point gleamed with ice, and the valley below seemed like another world entirely. Today promised a marathon of hiking, but first we soaked in the views and shed our outer layers to enjoy the crisp alpine air.",
          "We left Bonhomme early in the morning, trekking as a small group of three Germans and myself, gradually picking up more hikers along the descent. The trail down was a mix of steep, slanted rocks and slippery patches from water, turning the hike into a constant balance challenge. Rivers cascaded alongside us, and eventually the green valley floor appeared, dotted with cows whose cowbells created a constant jingling soundtrack. Herded by a vigilant farmer and her dog, the cows gave us a memorable encounter in the alpine fields.",
          "The path wasn't always straightforward. We missed a turn and ended up bushwhacking across fields, past abandoned farmhouses, before reconnecting with a paved road that led to Ville des Glaciers. From there, I diverged from the group to tackle the ascent to my next stop: Refuge Robert Blanc. The refuge appeared as a tiny brown dot on a distant mountainside nearly 1,000 meters above me. The climb tested every ounce of energy, with waterfalls crossing my path and cairns guiding me over rocks and switchbacks.",
          "Arriving at the refuge was a relief. The downtime at these mountain shelters can feel long, but the view, fresh alpine air, and camaraderie make it worthwhile. Clouds rolled in before dinner, cloaking the mountainside in mist, while we enjoyed a hearty meal and met fellow hikers. I later discovered I had missed a shortcut across the top of the mountains: the optional trail to Tête Nord de Fours, which would have saved some serious elevation gain. Live and learn.",
          "Being this high, removed from everything below, is intoxicating. But with tomorrow's hike looming, I knew the mountains were not done testing me. Every step, every climb, and every breath reminds me why I keep returning to trails like these.\n"
        ],
        "excerpt": "At 2,665 meters, the Col des Fours is breathtaking but the hike down into valleys, cow-filled fields, and the long ascent to Refuge Robert Blanc proved that beauty comes with a serious challenge.",

          "I started the day eager to hike toward the Col de la Seigne, but a lack of research quickly reminded me that mountains don't always follow your expectations. Instead of a simple descent, the trail cut straight across the face of Mont Tondu, a technical traverse filled with slippery clay, boulders, steel cables, and chains. Every step was a challenge, forcing me to balance, scramble, and trust my trekking poles, while constantly scanning for cairns and double yellow trail markers to stay on course. By the time I reached the final vertical climb to the col, the feeling was not just relief, it was pure triumph. I had pushed myself and emerged stronger for it.",
          "The Col de la Seigne itself offered breathtaking views back into France and forward into Italy. I pressed on quickly, descending with a newfound confidence I'd developed from past speed-hiking techniques, weaving past cow herders and their grazing flocks while keeping my eyes on the next ascent. Rifugio Elisabetta flashed by, and then I was racing toward the valley floor and Lac Combal, the mountains around me shifting from grasses to bushes and trees, with Mont Blanc looming silently in the clouds above.",
          "The afternoon was a mix of ups and downs, the terrain constantly reminding me of the magnitude of the Alps. By the time I reached my destination, I was high above the valley floor again, awed by the perspective that only comes from being this far up. Mont Blanc hid behind clouds for the day, leaving me focused on the lake-studded paths and the returning herds of cows that made the trail an obstacle course of its own. Running low on water added another element of tension, but the thought of the refuge kept me moving.",
          "Arriving at the evening's refuge was a relief in every sense. Ponies and horses greeted me at the door, curious and insistent on joining the dining room. Familiar faces from earlier in the trip trickled in, along with a hiker from Barcelona I had met days prior. The views of the valley below were spectacular, the beds welcoming, and the dinner a well-earned reward after a day of relentless hiking and scrambling.",
          "As the sky softened in the evening, I reflected on the day's challenges. The mix of technical climbs, slippery traverses, and cow-filled paths had tested every skill I had acquired on the trail. Yet despite the physical exhaustion, there was a deep satisfaction in knowing I had met the mountains head-on. Tomorrow promised new climbs, but tonight, the mountains were quiet, and so was I.\n"

          "The day began bright and sunny as I descended toward the skiing town of Courmayeur, transitioning from sandy trails to paved streets. Most of the hike took place under the forest canopy, offering glimpses of ski lifts and paths on the surrounding hills. Along the way, I passed an abandoned house tucked deep in the trees, its crumbling floors and holes in the roof telling silent stories of a life long gone. I couldn't resist exploring, marveling at the eerie beauty of forgotten spaces before continuing down the trail.",
          "Navigating the unstable terrain with sore knees made progress slow, and a sudden realization hit me: I desperately needed a bathroom. Fortunately, the bus station in the city center came to the rescue. With a sense of relief, I stocked up on cash and snacks before heading uphill to the town square. From there, I gazed over the valley, marveling at the village houses and mountains beyond. Courmayeur's streets were lined with luxury shops, wine tasting rooms, and high-end restaurants, a stark contrast to the rugged mountain trails just behind them.",
          "I reunited with Barak and Neta, whom I had met three days earlier, and we walked together until the first mountain ascent outside Villair. Rain began to fall, alternating between cooling drizzle and steady sheets, making the trail slippery and the rivers along the path challenging to cross. I didn't mind, the sound of rain on leaves has always been one of my favorite hiking companions. At Rifugio Bertone, 650 meters above Courmayeur, I took a break and snacked while waiting for Barak and Neta, enjoying the panoramic views of the Aosta Valley.",
          "The high passes of the day, Col Sapin and Pas Entre-Deux-Sauts, were deemed too dangerous under the worsening weather, so we took a flatter, safer route to our final Italian refuge. Even on mostly level ground, the trail was muddy and slick, forcing us to scramble over waterfalls, rivers, and ruins along the way. I paused at the ruins, imagining the people who had once called them home, before making a final push over a short, steep incline to our destination.",
          "The evening was a mix of exhaustion and comfort. I endured my second cold shower, learning the hard way that late arrivals mean less hot water. Dinner was a chance to reconnect with familiar faces from Les Houches and meet new hikers along the way. Outside, the clouds blanketed the mountains, obscuring the stars, but the day's sense of accomplishment and camaraderie made it a perfect alpine evening.\n"

          "The morning began under a blanket of clouds as I left the Rifugio, with Mont Blanc teasingly hidden from view. The trail took me past several abandoned buildings, and I couldn't resist exploring each one before descending along the zig-zagging path through the valley. Clumps of evergreens lined one side of the trail, while the stark gray cliffs of rockslides towered on the other. At a quiet river, I paused to snack and enjoy the gentle sound of rushing water, a rare moment of solitude before the ascent to Rifugio Elena.",
          "The wind greeted me fiercely at the Rifugio, howling around every rock and corner, forcing me to layer up before continuing to the Grand Col Ferret. I grabbed a warm sandwich and met up with Barak and Neta for a quick regroup. Outside, the wind made taking photos a challenge, but the anticipation of crossing into Switzerland kept us moving. The climb to the col was relentless, with clouds racing around our feet as we ascended to 2,537 meters, the trails seeming to vanish into nothingness at times.",
          "Crossing into Switzerland brought an unexpected stillness. The wind died, leaving only quiet. Probably the quietest I've ever experienced in nature. The sun began to peek through the clouds, illuminating fresh green mountains and grassy hills. I paused to rest, observing cows slowly herded below and the peaceful rhythm of alpine life. It was a moment to breathe and simply appreciate the world around me.",
          "Descending into the valley brought a surprise fright: a fast-moving cow trotting straight toward me. I jumped out of the way, and in a comedic twist, the cow leapt into the air before continuing down the trail. Thankfully, both of us survived unscathed, and I continued on my way, navigating rivers and lush green hills before reaching the small town of La Fouly. Along the way, I met a group of Irish hikers, and we helped each other find the path after a few minor misadventures.",
          "The evening offered a well-earned respite at Maya Joie, where I stocked up on supplies for the next day. Dinner was an unforgettable Swiss feast of Raclette, the melted cheese served with potatoes, devoured in three hearty servings. We ended the night with a game of Scrabble, full and satisfied, as the sun set behind the mountains. Tomorrow promised a gentler hike with only 500 meters of gain, a welcome reprieve after the challenges of the day.\n"

A backpacker we'd met at Maya Joie had told us about a massive waterfall just past La Fouly, and I was determined to check it out. Leaving town, we quickly found ourselves in the forest, descending toward a river crossing before continuing north toward the waterfall. What seemed like a gentle path revealed itself as steep and slippery with morning dew, but the payoff was breathtaking. I scrambled carefully near the base of the falls, feeling the spray on my face, and paused to savor the raw power and beauty of the cascading water.",
          "Once back on safer ground, we reunited with other hikers and continued together through the forest. Much of the trail followed a dried-up river, winding through narrow paths with occasional chains to keep us from tumbling over steep drops. Soon, we emerged into the valley villages of Switzerland, with Praz-de-Fort and its neighboring towns greeting us with charming wooden houses, blending new construction with centuries-old barns that looked ready to collapse at the slightest touch. We rested at a cozy café in Issert, indulging in ice cream sandwiches while taking in the surrounding greenery.",
          "The day's climb was deceptively short, about 1.5 hours and under 500 meters of gain, but full of delightful surprises along the way. A cave tempted exploration, and the forest was alive with whimsical wooden carvings of mushrooms, beavers, and antelope. We even spotted locals scaling a small rocky outcrop, a reminder that mountains invite adventure at every turn. The final stretch brought us to the lake at Campex, where we enjoyed pizza and beers before heading to our separate accommodations for the night.",
          "Navigating to my Gîte turned into an unintended adventure of its own. I got lost. Four times. Testing both my patience and problem-solving skills. From following the wrong paths to asking directions from an elderly Swiss lady whose advice involved circular hand gestures, I eventually found my way thanks to a group of helpful teenagers. The misadventures faded as quickly as they came; my Gîte was warm and welcoming, and dinner with a new South Korean friend brought laughter and cultural exchange. I even learned to say \"Annyeonghaseyo,\" though it may take a few more tries to remember it.",
          "By the end of the day, I felt a mix of exhilaration and gratitude, exhilaration from the waterfall and winding trails, and gratitude for the kindness of strangers, the beauty of the Swiss villages, and the resilience built with each step. It was a day that reminded me why I love hiking: the perfect blend of challenge, discovery, and the simple joys of connecting with people along the way.\n"

          "The day started under perfect blue skies, with sunlight streaming through the trees as I hiked through the woods in the early morning. There's something magical about walking through a forest with light filtering down in golden beams, it makes every step feel deliberate and slow. Since I had explored parts of the trail the night before, the first 30 minutes were easy, giving me time to enjoy the scenery and prepare for the bigger climb ahead.",
          "My destination was the Fenetre d'Arpette at 2,665 meters, the second-highest point I'd reach on the TMB. The initial ascent led through woods, then shrubs, low trees, and finally into sparse crabgrass and rocks. Every few minutes I turned around to take in the ever-expanding view, the mountains and valleys stretching farther than I could capture in a single photo. As the vegetation disappeared entirely, the landscape became a raw, rocky terrain, signaling the approach to the day's biggest challenge.",
          "Just below the summit, I faced a massive field of boulders, some the size of camper vans. Unlike previous boulder fields, these moved slightly underfoot, demanding complete focus and careful navigation. I hugged enormous rocks, climbed over others, and constantly searched for the white-and-red trail markers or cairns that would guide me safely upward. Once past this obstacle, I paused in awe at the accomplishment, knowing the scariest part of the climb was behind me.",
          "The final zig-zag path to the summit brought me to Barak and Neta, and together we shared lunch and photos while soaking in the views. But the descent proved even more challenging. The steep, slippery slope required constant attention, with Glacier du Trient stretching to the left and a smooth rock face carved by its life below. I moved quickly, jumping down sections despite bad knees, eager to reach the river below.",
          "By mid-afternoon, we regrouped at a local riverside bar, enjoying the presence of other hikers and locals alike. Our final destination for the day was Refuge du Peuty, an absolute gem. Run by two women who cook with ingredients from their own garden (and even include flowers in dinner!), the refuge offered warmth, good music, and an unforgettable dining experience. It was the perfect ending to a day filled with breathtaking climbs, nerve-testing boulders, and the quiet triumph of reaching the summit.\n"

          "We bid farewell to our hostesses at Refuge du Peuty, thanked them for the unforgettable dinner and music, and set off for the final Col of our trek. I surged ahead of the group, hiking through the tree-covered trail, where the receding village and valley floor were hidden from view. Once I broke above the treeline, the vistas returned in full force: mountains plunging dramatically toward the valleys below, dotted with pink wildflowers and abandoned houses.",
          "Our destination for the morning was Refuge du Col de Balme, a remote building perched where Switzerland meets France. Here, the border felt purely symbolic; nature knows no lines. From this vantage point, Mont Blanc came into sight again after nearly nine days, a majestic reminder of the journey we had undertaken.",
          "We continued across rolling hills toward Aig des Posettes, today's high point. The climb was mostly easy, with only minor scrambling, and the skies were alive with hang gliders drifting gracefully above. We paused on the rocky terrain to enjoy snacks composed of chocolate, banana chips, and nuts, soaking in the incredible panorama of mountains stretching in all directions.",
          "The descent back under the tree cover was gentle yet physically demanding. The trail shifted from rocks to sandy dirt to leafy paths, each surface cushioning the impact on weary legs and knees. Switchbacks wound down toward the Auberge where we would spend the night, marking the close of another incredible day on the TMB.",
          "Evening brought rest, games, and connections with fellow hikers. I learned to play Taki (the Israeli version of Uno) and shared dinner with Dutch companions, picking up a few words in the process. As the sun set, the sky erupted in bright purple and the mountains glowed pink, a perfect ending to a day filled with awe-inspiring views and the quiet satisfaction of being deep in the heart of the Alps.\n"

          "Everyone warned me about the ladders, claiming they were the scariest part of the trip, but with the alternate route closed due to a landslide, there was no avoiding them. The morning sun peeked over the mountains as we left Tré-le-Champ and entered the woods. We steadily climbed, navigating tree roots and rocky outcroppings, including the massive Aiguillete d'Argentière monolith, a rock the size of a two-story house that had long ago fallen from the mountain's peak.",
          "Along the trail, we paused at a perfect window in the rocks, framed by trees, to watch the sun's rays play over Mont Blanc in the distance. Even wildlife joined the spectacle as an Ibex leapt gracefully from rock to rock, seemingly unconcerned by our presence. Soon, we reached the ladders. Contrary to the stories, they weren't frightening, just metal rungs helping us navigate the steeper terrain, though the line of hikers waiting for photos turned it into a social affair.",
          "After the ladders, the mountains opened up to a series of lakes, each more stunning than the last. Lac Blanc, with its turquoise waters reflecting Mont Blanc itself, was breathtaking. I braved a frigid swim, the icy water like a thousand needles on my skin, and couldn't resist a second dip. Coffee brewed nearby while we soaked in the sun and let our gear dry, a perfect Alpine pause before continuing.",
          "By late afternoon, we arrived at Refuge de l'Flegère, only to witness an unexpected spectacle: a fire across the valley. Emergency crews in helicopters tirelessly ferried water from a nearby reservoir to douse the blaze. Watching the precise, almost choreographed effort left me in awe of both the firefighters and the machinery.",
          "The evening brought a sense of calm and camaraderie. We played card games, shared dinner with fellow Israeli hikers, and stepped outside later to gaze at the night sky. The Milky Way stretched overhead, only slightly dimmed by the sparkling lights of Chamonix in the valley below. A perfect end to a day of adventure, awe, and Alpine beauty.\n"

        "excerpt": "Ladders, icy lake swims, and a helicopter battle with fire. This Alpine day combined thrills, beauty, and awe in equal measure.",

          "I thought today would be a leisurely three-hour hike to the last mountain refuge of the trip, but I was quickly proven wrong. I started out slowly, strolling under ski lifts and along gently sloping forest paths, enjoying the crisp morning air. The trail soon challenged me with steep boulder fields, each with dizzying drops below, far more intimidating than anything I had encountered so far. The pictures hardly do the scale justice.",
          "Shortly after the boulder field, a massive stone wall appeared, silent and imposing. Ahead, a mysterious red plastic pole led some hikers to believe the main path was closed, prompting me to take a higher alternate route. I pushed myself up the hill, only to discover the original path was open after all. Turning back cost me time, but the trail rewarded me with ethereal light and cloud formations that made it feel like the mountain itself was alive. At one point, the sun and clouds conjured the illusion of an asteroid about to strike the valley.",
          "The climb to the top of Le Brévent at 2,526 meters was the day's true test. Two hours of scrambling over shaky rocks and negotiating ladders later, I reached the summit. Mont Blanc towered across the valley, still 2,000 meters higher, but the view and the exhilaration made it feel like I was nearly on par. Hang gliders launched fearlessly from the edge nearby, adding a sense of vertiginous thrill to the scene.",
          "The descent was equally challenging, and I raced down as quickly as my knees allowed, eager for quiet after the bustling trails. By the time I reached the Bellechat refuge, I was the first to check in. The tiny mountain refuge quickly filled with fellow hikers, including a lively Dutch group who shared stories, taught me new words, and kept the evening entertaining.",
          "Dinner was a warm, communal affair, punctuated by tales of family history during World War II. The quiet of the high mountains settled in afterward, and I went to bed early, both reflecting on the day's trials and bracing myself for the final leg of the trek tomorrow.\n"

          "The last morning of the trek was bathed in a stunning orange sunrise, which I tried to capture in every photo as I descended the mountains. Ibexes kept me company along the way, adding a touch of Alpine magic. On my path, I passed the imposing Le Christ Roi statue, a sudden and awe-inspiring sight rising from the valley floor. Crossing the final river and passing the train station, I felt a sense of completion: the journey that had begun days ago now behind me. My hiking boots and backpack were no longer black, but coated with the dust and dirt of countless mountainsides.",
          "With the gîte not opening until later in the afternoon, I wandered around town, exploring souvenir shops and collecting maps. By chance, I ran into four fellow hikers I had met along the route. We shared lunch, drinks, and stories, laughing over mishaps and memories from the trek. A sudden rainstorm forced us inside, reminding me just how unpredictable mountain weather can be.",
          "Once checked in, I was reunited with more friends from day one. One kind hiker even lent me a bus pass to visit Chamonix in search of a pin for my backpack, part of a growing collection from my travels. Chamonix was bustling, filled with shops, restaurants, and tourists. Speed-walking up and down its streets, I finally found the perfect pin and met Barak and Neta one last time, sharing a few laughs before returning for dinner.",
          "Dinner that evening was lively, with tipsy friends spilling wine and telling stories. We lingered in the common room afterward, savoring the camaraderie that had grown over the past days. As night fell, I reflected on the journey, the challenges, the beauty, and the friendships forged along the way.",
          "The next morning, the shuttle sped past the mountains as I headed to the airport. I looked back longingly at the peaks, knowing this trek had changed me. While it wasn't as grueling as the Camino, it had its own trials and triumphs, leaving me stronger and more in awe of Europe than ever before. I cannot wait to return.\n"

          "The morning air was crisp and fresh, exactly as early summer mornings should be. I tied my shoes, slung my backpack over my shoulders, and stepped outside, feeling a mixture of excitement and nervous anticipation. Standing on Rue de la Citadelle in St-Jean-Pied-de-Port, I felt slightly out of place in shoes that weren't broken in and a hat from Lollapalooza. It was June 2nd, 2018, and I was about to begin the Camino de Santiago.",
          "As I paused to take in the early morning light, I tried to make sense of what I was doing and what lay ahead. Pilgrims passed me on the stone-paved road, moving steadily toward the horizon. After a moment of hesitation, I muttered to myself, \"alright, let's go,\" and started following three women walking ahead. The sun shone bright, the clouds were few, and soon we left the village behind, stepping into the quiet beauty of the countryside.",
          "Before long, the three women stopped, unsure of the path. Passing them confidently, I offered the best advice I could: \"Yeah, I think so.\" That small interaction changed everything. What started as a solo journey quickly became a shared experience with new friends: Amy from the USA, Martha from the UK, and Tracey from Australia. Together we walked, talked, and climbed, gradually rising above the clouds with each step, the man-made world shrinking behind us.",
          "Mid-morning brought us to Orisson, exhausted from the relentless uphill walk. We rested, refueled with water, and then continued, enveloped in fog and cool air that softened the climb. As the path curved and twisted through the mountains, I kept hoping each bend would reveal the summit. The trail left the paved road near the border of Spain, and after hours of ascending, we finally began our descent. The forest was dense and muddy, demanding full concentration, and I even slipped before exiting into Roncesvalles.",
          "Arriving at our destination felt like a reward. Clean clothes, hot showers, and the warmth of shared meals with fellow pilgrims made the day's struggles feel worthwhile. The monastery dorms buzzed with laughter and conversation, and for the first time, I felt the Camino's sense of community. Tomorrow we would descend the Pyrenees toward Zubiri, hoping for dry trails and steady steps, ready for the next chapter of this unforgettable journey.\n"

          "The chirping of birds filled the dormitory as I rolled onto my side and pushed myself up from the bottom bunk. After a hasty packing session, I made one last check of my bag before heading downstairs. The morning felt crisp and calm, a quiet contrast to the strenuous hike from the day before. Outside, the rolling hills and mountains we had conquered yesterday stretched before me, serene and inviting.",
          "After grabbing some snacks from the vending machine, I retrieved my boots from the musty storage room and slung my backpack over my shoulders. The others had already gathered downstairs, ready to set off. Amy and I found ourselves walking in the street at first, the trail too muddy to traverse safely. Soon we passed through a small town, descending a slope before returning to the trail. Trees lined our left side while cows grazed on our right, and we joked with the horses, though they offered little response.",
          "We paused to admire the sunrise cresting over the hills behind us. Later, we stopped in a quiet town at the only open café, enjoying a brief respite before the trail took us back into the trees and up more hills. Music accompanied us through dense woods, opening up to prairies of tall grass bathed in sunlight. The day was full of ups and downs, each step demanding effort, yet each view was breathtaking. I wished I had stopped more often to take it all in.",
          "A small stream followed alongside a concrete path as we descended, swelling into a river that we crossed by stepping along concrete pillars acting as a makeshift dam. On the other side, a roadside bar tempted us with beer and wine at 9:30 am, a treat for early days on the Camino. The terrain alternated between bare rock and dense trees, and eventually a fork in the path opened up a perfect view of the tree-covered hills beyond. From here, our route led downward toward Zubiri.",
          "The trail became unrelenting, bedrock jutting at sharp angles and slippery mud making every step precarious. A small snack stand offered a curious custom: donate underwear and your wish to meet a future husband would be granted. While we passed on the donation, we enjoyed food and shade as familiar faces arrived. After two more hours of hiking, nearly rolling my ankle a dozen times, we finally reached Zubiri. Finding the cozy municipal Albergue took some time, but soon we settled in. Clouds rolled in and rain began just as our friends arrived, giving us the chance to meet new companions while sheltering in a local café. This night marked the first true immersion into the Camino, a night no longer buffered by modern comforts. Ahead, the walled city famous for the running of the bulls in Pamplona awaited, along with more green hills to explore.\n"

          "A misty rain and low gray clouds accompanied us as we grabbed breakfast at the café from the previous night. We crossed the bridge that had brought us into town and headed toward the hills, the damp chill in the air a quiet reminder of the Camino's unpredictability. For a brief stretch, industrial sites broke the green landscape, but soon we traded paved roads for gravel paths, leaving the town shrinking behind us into a multicolored dot on a hillside.",
          "Nature quickly enveloped us as we left the gravel road for a narrow stone-paved trail climbing toward the light rain. Poppies lined the path, barbed wire fences marked off pastures, and donkeys stared curiously as we passed. The rushing Arga River appeared on our right just as the sun began to break through the clouds, and we stopped for a brief respite at a café on the outskirts of Zuriáin. The scenery was mesmerizing, each step alternating between rolling hills and tree-lined paths, and each glance back revealing more of the quiet towns behind us.",
          "I soon reached a fork in the trail where the main path led to Pamplona, and a smaller detour climbed to Zabaldica. I chose the detour, finding a 12th-century church, Iglesia de San Esteban, perched at the top. I lit a candle, explored the bell tower, and took photos of the surrounding hills. On the dusty descent, I came across a small snack stand under an old farmhouse where I grabbed an apple and left a donation before continuing along quiet hillside paths, tunnels under highways, and tree-lined roads toward Trinidad de Arre.",
          "Realizing I had lost sight of my Camino companions, I quickened my pace through empty streets and soon found them resting at a small town square café. The final approach to Pamplona took us through some of the busiest and shadiest urban streets I had ever walked, eventually opening up to a small park and the massive stone walls of the walled city. Crossing the drawbridge, we entered a world of color: each building painted in bright shades of pink, blue, green, or yellow, fountains scattered throughout, and young people filling the streets.",
          "We settled into a comfortable albergue, a welcome change after the shock of Zubiri. Nearby, Meson de la Navarreria offered food and drinks, and I took the chance to explore the city. I ran into Tania from Roncesvalles with her Camino friend Alex, and together we walked the ramparts overlooking the city and its outskirts. The church was still dark and quiet, not yet ready for visitors, but the main square buzzed with life. While the hills were beautiful, I was ready for some flat ground. Tomorrow promised a new adventure, with a visit to the monument at Alto de Perdon and the city of Puente la Reina awaiting us.\n"

        "excerpt": "A misty morning led us through the hills and rivers of the Basque Country, with poppies and curious donkeys along the way. By the afternoon, Pamplona's colorful walled city welcomed us, a vibrant contrast to the quiet trails we had left behind.",

          "Mornings in Pamplona had a calm, peaceful rhythm that I could get used to. With the streets empty, I set out ahead of the others to explore parts of the city I hadn't seen yesterday. Only a few pilgrims passed in the opposite direction, heading toward the next stage of the Camino. The city square was quiet, but as I ventured outward, I found bustling streets filled with early activity. I admired the architecture and strolled through several parks, though the arena where the bulls run was off-limits, leaving me slightly disappointed. Soon I returned to the Albergue to meet up with the group.",
          "Leaving Pamplona was quicker than entering it, and before long, the city was behind us. We zigzagged through small and large parks before returning to the open countryside, where green fields stretched endlessly beneath clouds that seemed to reach for the hills. Rainbows appeared at the edges of the clouds, a magical backdrop to the gravel paths snaking through forests, rivers, and open fields. The terrain gradually rose toward Zariquiegui, the last stop before crossing the windy Alto de Perdon.",
          "I caught up with Tania, Shelby, and Alex in Zariquiegui, and after a short break, we slowly made our way up the mountain. Along the ascent, we leapfrogged each other, pausing to take photos or waiting for others to catch up. The summit rewarded us with expansive views of the countryside in all directions, though the wind made it feel even more remote. The descent was slow and challenging, and once we reached flat ground, I found myself entirely alone.",
          "Alone on the trail, I began talking to myself, processing thoughts I had never spoken aloud. I reflected on why I was walking the Camino, my career dissatisfaction, sources of joy, and the emptiness I often carried. It was liberating to give voice to these hidden thoughts and to confront things I hadn't fully acknowledged. The walk became meditative, a conversation with myself, with the Camino as the silent witness.",
          "Eventually I met up with the group again near Urtega, enjoying lunch at a small Albergue in the sun. We spread out again through Obanos before arriving in Puente la Reina. At the edge of town, a historic Albergue caught our attention, and after some debate, we settled at Albergue Reparadores, one of the oldest on the Camino. Some of us cooked dinner, while others shared what they had. Though the day's terrain and distance were manageable, the back-to-back walking left my feet feeling it. Tomorrow promised flatter paths toward Estella, a welcome change.\n"
        ],
        "excerpt": "From quiet mornings in Pamplona to windy climbs over Alto de Perdon, the Camino forced both reflection and endurance. Talking to myself on the trail revealed thoughts I had never voiced, making the journey as much internal as external.",

          "The storks in the bell tower of the church next to the albergue were still asleep as the sun rose, casting a warm glow over the city. I set out ahead of the others for a quiet walk through the narrow stone streets of the old city, eventually reaching the east end of the queen's bridge that led out of town. On the far side, green-covered hills stretched into the distance, contrasting sharply with the stone streets behind me. I paused to take it all in, but familiar voices called my name. Tania, Shelby, and Alex were crossing the bridge, and I asked to join them for the day. They would become my Camino companions for the next several days.",
          "Autumn-colored fields greeted us as soon as we left the bridge, and the terrain remained relatively flat after crossing the highway that separated the last hills from the next village. A short detour through the village brought us to gently rolling fields of grain, small hills, and patchworks of farms. Low stone walls bordered the trail as it snaked past groves of trees, guiding us toward breakfast in Cirauqui. The medieval hilltop city rose above the fields with walls at its base and roads that wound in every direction.",
          "After breakfast, we continued alongside a highway, passing under bridges, through valleys, and even a cat perched precariously on a fence. An hour later, we entered Villatuerta and paused at the Plaza Mayor to rest. Once the others arrived and our bellies were full, we left for the evening's destination. Beyond the town, a lone mountain seemed to watch over us as we walked through empty fields, taking the long route around a small church standing in the middle of the landscape. The dirt path gradually resolved into the road leading into Estella.",
          "On the outskirts of the city, a massive half-ruined church caught my eye. I photographed its smoothly rounded pillars through the gate before rejoining the group near a town map. We debated whether to keep walking or stay in Estella. Though we had arrived early, the albergue we initially found was unwelcoming, so we turned back into the old city, tucked behind stone walls and tightly packed houses. Our beds overlooked the street from a second-floor balcony, offering a peaceful view.",
          "With the day mostly done, we headed across the street to a bar for snacks and drinks. An afternoon nap followed, with the sound of a Spanish guitar drifting up from the streets below. Later, we played card games, enjoyed calimochos, and had a quick pizza dinner. It had been a relatively uneventful day, but full of calm and charm. Tomorrow promised walking through rolling fields under clear blue skies as we made our way to Los Arcos.\n"

        "excerpt": "A calm morning in Estella gave way to gentle fields, medieval towns, and quiet streets. By afternoon, we settled into the old city, enjoying a relaxed pace, music, and shared moments before the next day's journey.",

          "Another calm morning greeted us on the Camino, cloudy skies overhead as we retraced our steps from the previous day. With the Ega River at our backs, we walked along dirt paths lined with vine-covered stone walls. A fork in the road presented a choice: left for a shorter hike, or right for a longer one. We went right, drawn by the promise of the wine fountain in Irache and find it we did. Free red wine flowed from a spout at the winery, an indulgence at 7:30 in the morning that left our lips stained purple. Refreshed and slightly tipsy, we returned to the path and pressed on toward Monjardin.",
          "The trail led us through forests, up and down hills, humidity rising as the pyramid-shaped Monjardin mountain grew larger with each step. From hilltops, we glimpsed an endless patchwork of green fields, red rooftops, and a sky trying to pierce the gray clouds above. A light drizzle fell as we paused in Azqueta, refreshing and cool, before reaching Villamayor de Monjardin. There, a medieval fountain provided shelter and water as we prepared for a 12-kilometer stretch with no shade or water.",
          "After an hour of rough, muddy paths, the hills opened into fields of green and yellow, and the gray clouds began to disperse. Sunlight brightened the landscape, revealing a dirt path that split the fields down the middle. In the distance, a small food stand played Mexican music, offering a momentary distraction before the long, uninterrupted march toward Los Arcos. To keep my mind engaged, I popped in headphones, and music carried me forward. A few songs, like \"Maps\" by Handsome Ghost and \"Full Release\" by Little Monarch, grabbed me completely, pulling me into the moment as the fields, sky, and fellow pilgrims blurred around me.",
          "The dirt paths eventually led us to Los Arcos, a charming village lined with farms. We skipped the smelly farm-adjacent albergue and continued on toward Torres del Rio. Early Camino life meant we hadn't yet learned the rhythm of small Spanish towns, but the clean stone streets and beautiful church in Los Arcos made the pause worthwhile. Though Torres del Rio lay just a half kilometer further, the group collectively decided to stop at Sansol, a small village with a Moroccan-themed albergue and breathtaking views. That evening, we enjoyed a delicious tajine dinner and cooled our feet in the courtyard's icy pool, a small but perfect slice of bliss.",
          "Blue skies and rolling fields stretched before us, finally the scenery I had been hoping for since day one. Tomorrow promised Logroño, and with it, the challenge of walking into a larger city. For now, the Camino rewarded us with flat paths, warm sun, and a sense of quiet contentment that only comes from moving steadily through beautiful landscapes.\n"

          "Morning arrived gently in Torres del Rio, with a soft breeze drifting through open windows and tossing the thin lace curtains in its wake. The sunrise was spectacular, with burning reds, glowing pinks, and warm yellows spreading across the fields. I had never seen nature so alive and radiant at this early hour. As we left the town and began the climb, I stole a look back at Monjardin across the fields. For the first time, I could truly measure the distance we had already traveled, and it was humbling.",
          "Our path led past decorative cairns stacked in intricate formations and trees adorned with colorful ribbons, tokens of respect and remembrance from past pilgrims. Old stone benches and abandoned farmhouses occasionally appeared, some damaged by those seeking quick relief during the journey. Steep ascents and descents emerged unexpectedly, and a French companion showed us how to walk downhill \"like a monkey\" to reduce strain on our knees. It looked awkward but worked surprisingly well.",
          "Viana appeared in the distance as we returned to the highway, with passing cars offering either encouragement or disdain. We stopped briefly for some window shopping and I replaced my Lollapalooza hat with a full-brimmed one, a necessity after suffering another sunburn. The small church in town was beautiful despite its modest exterior and open-air courtyard, the result of a fire in the 13th century. Soon we left Viana behind and returned to the familiar dirt paths, fields, and countryside that have begun to feel like home.",
          "Arrows and messages made of pebbles dotted the sides of the trail, remnants from past pilgrims, guiding us toward Logroño. Wooden steps carried us over the highway, and I turned back to see Viana shrinking in the distance, a reminder of both how far we had come and how far we still had to go. Rain returned as a companion, and the path became paved again. Careful steps were required to avoid caterpillars crossing the trail. Soon, signs marked our entry into La Rioja, the region celebrated for its red wine.",
          "The final stretch led us along the Ebro River and through city parks, streets glistening from fresh rain. The Puente de Piedra carried us into the old town, where quiet streets and nearly empty sidewalks made navigation tricky. After consulting the tourist center for a map, we settled on an albergue near the edge of the old city that offered beds and dinner at a fair price. Logroño is a beautiful city, its streets decorated with charm, and the massive church at the center commanding attention with each chime of the bells. We found some familiar faces (Martha, Amy, and Tracey) relaxing in the main square. Despite the city's size, the Camino's magic persisted. Tomorrow promised smaller towns and calmer streets, and I hoped my new hat would finally be enough to protect me from the sun.\n"

          "he day began with empty stomachs. Our assumption that a café would always be open early proved unreliable, and Logroño left us high and hungry as we departed the city. We trudged along city parks and bike paths, every closed store and silent café a reminder that the next opportunity for food lay 13 kilometers ahead.",
          "The sky was a deep, perfect blue, punctuated by soft gray and white clouds. Tall trees and poppy fields drew our attention, but hunger quickly returned. Then, around a bend, the sight stopped us in our tracks: a shimmering lake, still hidden from the morning sun, surrounded by dark hills. Its calm surface reflected the deep blue sky and instantly cleared our minds.",
          "Relief, and joy, came shortly after at a café on the water's edge. Plastic tables and freshly brewed coffee felt like heaven. As we ate, a family of swans emerged from the lake, their elegance a perfect complement to our surroundings. Full stomachs and caffeinated blood restored our energy for the journey ahead.",
          "Later, we encountered Marcelo Lobato, a walking legend who has traveled nearly 5,000 miles across Europe. With a stamp from him in our pilgrim passports, we continued past the highway and into the rolling farmlands. Eight kilometers later, we arrived in Navarrete, a circular hilltop town. We wandered its streets to reach the church, marveling at the centuries-old altars and gold-covered saints.",
          "The longest stretch of walking yet lay ahead. Nearly 16 kilometers through farmland, dotted with occasional trees and distant white mounds growing into buildings. In Ventosa, we decided to push all the way to Nájera, avoiding intermediate stops. The terrain was unforgiving, and by the last hill, my hips and feet were screaming.",
          "Music helped me cope, and as I reached the summit, \"Believer\" by American Authors began playing: 'I'm a believer that things will get better.'",
          "The lyrics hit me like a ton of bricks. All the pain, all the stress, the struggle of walking, and the hardships of life, they will get better. It was overwhelming. Nearly in tears, Tania and I descended into Nájera, finally finding beds at Las Pena on the city's edge.",
          "After a lunch and drinks along the river, and a much-needed nap, we regrouped with friends, sharing wine and chocolates in the sun. The Camino continues to introduce me to people who make the days richer and the miles more meaningful. Tomorrow, Santo Domingo awaits, with a ghost town along the way.\n"

          "Not a cloud in the big blue sky greeted me as I retrieved the hanging laundry, packed my bag, and stepped outside. Pilgrims passed by the Albergue one by one, heading up the hill and out of sight. Food was on my mind after yesterday's debacle, so I made for the cafés in the opposite direction.",
          "Most people were already there or slowly arriving, securing breakfast or double-checking gear. I dropped my bag at a table and ordered the first thing I saw: a Spanish tortilla. Full and eager to start, I told everyone I'd see them in Santo Domingo, hoisted my pack, and climbed the densely packed cobblestone road toward the trail.",
          "Tania was nowhere to be seen, but her trekking poles were gone, so she was probably already ahead. I emptied my pockets of trash, extended my poles, and fell into a steady rhythm. The morning's uphill walk forced me to shed my jacket as soon as I crested the hill, revealing irrigated farmland and distant mountains flanking the horizon. I didn't know it then, but it would be a long while before The Way took us through mountains again.",
          "Water ran through pipes and canals alongside the trail, as the farmland transformed from small green plants to bushes, and back. Poppies erupted in vivid reds along one side, while the other fields were meticulously maintained to keep intruders at bay. The sun was relentless, and by the time I reached Azofra, the first town for a break, I was moving well and didn't stop. Perhaps a mistake.",
          "After Azofra, the trail turned sharply toward the highway, then veered left into pure countryside. For the next 13 kilometers to Cirueña, there were no detours or rest stops. Still, I couldn't focus on the heat or the long stretch; my eyes were locked on the endless green fields in front of me. The gravel path of The Way sliced through the landscape like a bullet, splitting the verdant world in two. Islands of trees dotted distant hills, tractor lines stretched straight toward them, and wisps of white clouds traced shadows across the fields.",
          "Finally, a rest stop appeared atop a steep hill, with benches, reclining chairs, and tiny statues. A perfect place to snack and rest. Soon after came the ghost town of Cirueña. A nearby golf course offered bathrooms (essential at this point) and on my way out, I ran into Tania. We walked together for a while, weaving through empty developments back to the open fields.",
          "Santo Domingo slowly rose in the distance, dark gray clouds marching over southern hills. A herd of sheep accompanied us as we approached town. The Albergue was massive, with excellent amenities, and just as I checked in, the rain began to fall. With bars and restaurants closed for Sunday, we followed the usual routine: shower, laundry, nap.",
          "Back in Logroño, I realized my flip-flops were inadequate for walking in town. A nearby store offered hiking sandals, and my investment felt like walking on air, saving my feet from the thin straps that had been tearing at them. I tested them on a stroll around town to get cash and visit the church, returning to find the others soaked from the rain.",
          "Later, Leon and I explored Santo Domingo for nearly two hours, talking about work, philosophy, and our futures. Dinner consisted of the simplest pleasure: real eggs, which tasted incredible after days of limited options on the Camino.",
          "Twenty kilometers felt easy today, with only brief stops, but the rain promised that tomorrow would bring a new challenge.\n"
        ],
        "excerpt": "Sun, endless green fields, and poppies in full bloom carried me through 20 kilometers to Santo Domingo. Rain, sandals, and simple eggs reminded me why the Camino is as much about the small joys as the long miles.",

          "I left Santo Domingo de la Calzada at seven in the morning, walking alone. I can't remember exactly why. Perhaps I was eager to start, maybe the others were sleeping in, or the forecast of heavy afternoon rain pushed me forward. The stage was meant to be short, and I could have slept longer, but the sun was already up, hidden behind clouds, as I stepped out into the fields.",
          "Green farm fields stretched on either side, familiar from yesterday's walk. I kept my head down and focused on each step, quietly hoping that my knee would improve on its own. Granon passed without pause, then Redecilla del Camino, and before I knew it, I had left Basque territory and entered Castilla y Leon, the widest region on the Camino.",
          "After a quick break in Redecilla, I passed through Castildelgato, noticing an old gate guarding a field. I wondered what it had protected long ago. Viloria de Rioja came next, where I chatted briefly with a fellow pilgrim I had seen in Santo. They were carrying a MacBook, using a porter service, which explained how they managed the extra weight. I stopped briefly at the open Albergue but decided not to linger, choosing instead to keep moving.",
          "As soon as I left Viloria, the blue sky returned and rolling green hills appeared in every direction. The cultivated slopes stretched to the top, almost making me miss a step. I arrived in Villamayor del Rio shortly after, pulled out some peanuts, and readied my rain jacket. I avoided the poncho, a choice I would soon regret. Not long after leaving, the first raindrops fell, and then it poured. My lower half was soaked through, though thankfully the supplies in my bag stayed dry.",
          "An hour later, I reached Belorado, carrying enough water in my shoes to fill a small bottle. The Municipal Albergue wasn't open yet, so I waited with other soaked pilgrims. After the rain let up, I explored the village before grabbing lunch at a small, dimly lit restaurant. The paella and wine were excellent, and the World Cup played on the TV. Back at the Albergue, I met my bunk mate, Crissi, who immediately appreciated my outlet extension cord.",
          "After a nap, Crissi and I wandered through the ruins of a church and up to the castle ruins on the hill, where the view of Belorado was incredible. Dinner at the Albergue introduced me to more pilgrims, including two Texans who quickly became friends. What began as a damp, solitary walk ended with new companions, good conversation, and a sense of anticipation for tomorrow's 30-kilometer trek to Ages, with a forecast promising no rain in the afternoon.\n"

          "I woke early to the stirring of fellow pilgrims, finding both neighboring bunk beds already empty. Crissi had left too, likely with the first wave of walkers, and I missed the chance to say goodbye. My shoes were still soaked from yesterday, but after clearing out the newspaper I had stuffed inside, I packed up and headed toward Tania and Shelby. The rest of the group had stayed at the first Albergue outside of town.",
          "By seven, Tania, Shelby, and a new pilgrim named Steve had finished breakfast and we were on the road toward Agés. A constant drizzle accompanied us, and Steve, without a raincoat, improvised one from garbage bags. After Tosantos, the others needed a break, so I pulled ahead, navigating mud-soaked paths and rain-filled landmines through Villambistia and Espinosa del Camino. Peanuts from yesterday's hike provided a brief snack, though they were quickly discarded.",
          "Villafranca Montes de Oca, once a Roman city named Auca, offered a welcome reprieve with a truck-stop style diner. I devoured half a massive sandwich and saved the rest for later. The way out of town led through steep, muddy woods, where the uphill slog was mostly lonely but softened by earthen trails. The monastery at San Juan de Ortega offered old-world charm and the faint smell of damp wood, and I briefly considered staying there before pushing onward.",
          "Emerging from the forest, I encountered a solitary tree marked with a yellow arrow. Beyond it stretched one of the most breathtaking views I had ever seen on the Camino. Fields rolled out in every direction, making me wonder how anyone could ever choose just one village to call home. Tania, Shelby, and Steve arrived, and we sat together, enjoying the sun and letting our laundry dry while snacking on chocolate.",
          "The day's adventure included a detour to Atapuerca, where pre-historic excavations revealed hidden treasures of ancient humans. Steve, a Spanish teacher, translated the guide's stories and shared fascinating details about the site. Returning by bus felt strange, watching pilgrims walk past us on the road, yet the experience was well worth it.",
          "The evening ended with a home-cooked meal from the hospitalarios, wine, laughter, and stories. After a day of rain, mud, and picture-perfect scenery, it felt incredible to share the trail with friends. Tomorrow promised a walk to the city of Burgos, and perhaps the last time I would see many of the companions I had met along the Camino.\n"

          "I woke to the sound of a rooster and the wind whipping across the exposed country road. Breakfast at the Albergue was a simple but filling serving of eggs and toast, my first homemade meal on the Camino, and a comforting start to the day. Once fueled, we set off on foot for Atapuerca, making a quick stop at a café for a small second breakfast before tackling a hill near the excavation site. At the top, a tall wooden cross overlooked the rolling fields, and a stone arrow pointed the way toward Burgos. Ahead, a silent spiral maze drew our attention, and we each took turns walking toward its center, a small wooden cross marking the goal. The calm simplicity of it was almost meditative.",
          "Reality called soon enough, as Burgos waited 17 kilometers down a steep descent. The walk was long and intense, with nearly 14 kilometers without a proper stop, yet the countryside scenery kept spirits high. Passing through villages and wide, cultivated fields, we finally approached the outskirts of the city. The route took us past a small airport and factory zones, and we navigated a tricky underpass under the highway before finally reaching the river, where a shaded bench became our lunch spot. Bread, chocolate, and cheese restored energy while familiar pilgrims passed by, sharing friendly nods and smiles.",
          "The riverwalk carried us into historic Burgos, a longer stretch than expected. We decided to upgrade for the night, booking a private room at Hostel Burgos for four of us. My first night without earplugs. After the usual laundry and shower routine, I headed to the cathedral. Its exterior was stunning, though the interior felt more like a museum, and I soon rushed to the Museum of Human Evolution to meet Steve and Shelby. The exhibits were fascinating, and the hands-on learning from Atapuerca the previous day made it even more vivid.",
          "Evening brought the rest of our Camino friends together. We found a tapas bar in the town square where each drink came with small bites, and shared laughs over several rounds of beer. Conversations drifted to taking a rest day, but I had to keep moving in order to finish on schedule. Saying goodbye was harder than I expected. After two weeks and nearly 300 kilometers of walking together, the impact of these companions had grown deeper than I anticipated. Each left a mark, and the thought of not seeing them again tugged at me.",
          "As night fell, I pushed those thoughts aside and focused on the road ahead. Tomorrow promised a 30-kilometer journey to Hontanas, a new day filled with familiar trails, unknown landscapes, and fresh experiences waiting just beyond the horizon.\n"
        ],
        "excerpt": "After a morning at Atapuerca and a long walk into Burgos, we explored the city, enjoyed tapas with friends, and reflected on the bonds formed over nearly 300 kilometers. Saying goodbye was hard, but tomorrow held a 30-kilometer trek to Hontanas and new adventures.",

A quick check of my locker revealed that I'd forgotten my towel, but Tania was awake to hand it to me, and I gave her one last hug before saying goodbye. Stepping out into the crisp morning air, I realized that I had no idea how to leave the city. Without a guidebook or anyone ahead to follow, I found the river and followed it blindly, my panic slowly subsiding as markers reappeared and I spotted other pilgrims in the distance.",
          "The walk out of the city brought me to the green fields and gravel paths I had grown to love, but also a stark reminder of solitude. A cracked pink heart etched into a stone marker perfectly captured my feelings as I left everyone behind. I pushed on, stopping briefly in Tarjados for breakfast and water, then continued through Rabé de las Calzadas, unaware that the Meseta heatwave and swarms of flies awaited me. Yet there were silver linings: hundreds of white butterflies surrounded me on a hill, keeping the flies at bay and turning the long, grueling day into something almost magical.",
          "Hornillos del Camino offered a welcome break. I rested on a bench, enjoyed a sandwich by the church fountain, and sipped a cold beer while soaking up the sun. Beyond the town, the flat Meseta stretched endlessly, barren and filled with flies. False promises of rest stops and shelter buildings wore me down until, finally, Hontanas appeared like a mirage. Nestled below the surrounding terrain, the town rose gradually from the horizon, offering sanctuary after one of the hardest days I'd faced so far.",
          "The joy of seeing familiar faces was overwhelming. Crissi, who had left Belorado days earlier without saying goodbye, stood waiting, and I nearly collapsed into a hug. Bianca and Mauro from Italy joined us, and together we booked beds and relaxed in the afternoon sun, a wave of relief and happiness washing over me. Later, another experienced pilgrim, Ciro, joined our group, sharing stories of his five Caminos and adding to the camaraderie.",
          "For the first time on the Camino, we cooked our own dinner. Bianca, Crissi, Mauro, and I pooled our resources in the small tienda kitchen, preparing a meal that felt both communal and celebratory. The setting sun bathed the rear deck in warm light as we ate, sipped wine, and reveled in the simple joy of food, friendship, and survival. Plans were made to leave early the next morning to beat the heat, ready to face the next stretch of the Meseta, including Boadilla del Camino, with renewed energy.\n"

        "excerpt": "After a punishing 30-kilometer trek across the Meseta, Hontanas appeared like a mirage, and seeing familiar faces, including Crissi, lifted my spirits. Together with new friends, we cooked, laughed, and savored one of the most memorable evenings on the Camino.",

          "Before the sun had risen, we packed our bags in the hallway, navigating the clutter left by other early risers. Locked doors threatened to slow us down, but after some creative exploring through the kitchen, we were finally free to hit the trail with our head torches on. Darkness shrouded the early miles, making the walk strangely faster, and our small group, Bianca, Crissi, and Maddy, marched steadily into the hills.",
          "As dawn broke, the sky turned a soft pink, revealing the ruins of the Convento de San Antón. The massive arches of this once grand pilgrim hospital framed the road perfectly as we approached Castrojeriz. Crossing groves of trees and a small river, the town appeared ahead, its church towering over the surrounding houses. Bianca showed off her barista skills at a café by the church, giving us the perfect caffeinated boost before we tackled the day's major climb.",
          "The Roman road led us to Alto de Mostelares, a steep incline that left us breathless but exhilarated. The descent was rough on my knees, yet the flat paths afterward allowed us to find a rhythm once more. We stopped at Fuente al Pioja to rest, enjoy snacks, and soak in the sun. The San Nicolás Chapel tempted us with the idea of disconnecting completely, but the pull of the trail was too strong to linger. Crossing the Rio Pisuerga marked our entry into the Tierra de Campos region and Palencia province.",
          "With music in our ears, Maddy and I power-walked the sunbaked gravel paths, finding cadence in the rolling hills. Itero de la Vega offered a refreshing lunch with hot sandwiches and cold beer, giving us energy for the long stretch ahead. Shade was scarce on the path, but the rhythm of our poles and the scenery kept us moving, mile after mile, until we reached Boadilla del Camino, the perfect stop to rest our legs.",
          "The push to Fromista tested us even further, nearly matching the distance of our previous stretch. Walking along the abandoned Canal de Castilla, we finally arrived in town around three in the afternoon after nearly ten hours of continuous movement. We checked in, found a comfortable place to stay, and celebrated with the World Cup on TV alongside Camino friends. Though we knew our legs would protest tomorrow, we felt accomplished. Crissi and Bianca had taken a gentler pace, camping at Boadilla, and we would reunite in Carrión, the gateway to what I had heard was called \"The Wasteland.\"",
          "The day was long, exhausting, and beautiful. Every mile carried its own challenges, from steep climbs and relentless sun to the joy of rolling hills, historic ruins, and the shared rhythm of a perfect walking companion. Even as fatigue set in, the Camino reminded me why I kept moving forward: the journey, the scenery, and the small moments of connection made every step worthwhile.\n"
        ],
        "excerpt": "We tackled ten hours of walking from Castrojeriz to Fromista, climbing steep hills, navigating sunbaked paths, and relishing every small reward along the way. By the time we arrived, exhaustion turned into satisfaction, and the Camino's beauty made every step worth it.",

          "The sun was still asleep as we packed up and set out for Carrión de los Condes. After yesterday's lightning-fast pace, today promised a calmer, steadier walk, but Maddy soon had to pause and take it easy. She urged me to keep going, promising she'd catch up later.",
          "The trail markers guided me like sentinels, each one marking a small gate along the path between Fromista and Carrión. With the sun rising behind me, I marched along the gravel, noting each kilometer, though their constant reminders of distance only tested my patience.",
          "Villarmentero de Campos offered the first chance for food. A bar decorated with scarecrows and mannequins looked a little eerie, but I grabbed a croissant and banana, used the bathroom, and pressed on. This would be the only pitstop before reaching Carrion.",
          "In Villalcazar de Sirga, I detoured through the town center to admire the church, said to be the last built by the Templars. I paused along the way, hoping to spot Maddy, but no familiar dots appeared on the horizon. The final stretch to Carrion seemed endless, but at 10 a.m., I finally reached the town square. Bar Carmen became my temporary home as I waited for the others, enjoying breakfast and practicing my Spanish with a patient bartender.",
          "Afterward, I explored the side streets and did some necessary shopping: a new money belt and a pair of sunglasses to replace the ones ruined earlier. Two hours later, Crissi and Bianca texted me: they'd secured beds at the Monasterio de Santa Clara. It was time to leave the bar, and I was more than ready to settle in.",
          "Without Wi-Fi but with the promise of cooking, we shopped for dinner supplies and gathered in the monastery courtyard. A little wine, meats, cheeses, and grapes made for a relaxed afternoon. I even bought my first Camino souvenir: a small yellow arrow pin, a symbol of the trail.",
          "Crissi and I wandered the parks near the river under the high sun, exploring as temperatures approached the upper 90s. Before dinner, we enjoyed a local Spanish guitar performance at the church. That evening, Ciro from Hontanas cooked a feast that left me fully satisfied. Crissi and I washed the dishes while belting out 1985 and Wannabe.",
          "Tomorrow we'd cross The Wasteland: 18 kilometers of nothing but the Meseta. If it weren't for the towns and the people we meet along the way, this stretch would be unbearable. The Camino proves, once again, that it's the small joys and connections that make each step worthwhile.\n"

        "excerpt": "A calmer day brought sun-soaked miles to Carrión de los Condes, where we reunited, shopped for essentials, and cooked a feast together in a monastery courtyard. Tomorrow, we face The Wasteland: 18 kilometers of Meseta with nothing but the horizon to guide us.",

          "Want to know a great way to start your day? First, buy some liquid deodorant when you get into town the night before, then shake it vigorously the next morning, preferably not in the direction of your eyes. Half-blind and puffy-eyed, I reluctantly put on my glasses and prepared for what would become one of the longest days on the Camino.",
          "At 5:30 a.m., Crissi and I left Carrion de los Condes, bound for the stretch some call The Wasteland. We followed the ancient Roman route, the Via Aquitana, across fields where yellow plains met distant green trees, the white gravel path stretching endlessly ahead. With little to see or do, we kept our heads down and focused on walking, grateful for the clouds that kept the temperature bearable.",
          "After 3.5 hours and a single stop at a small bench area, we reached Calzadilla de la Cueza. Halfway to Santiago already! But once breakfast was finished, the clouds disappeared, the sun beat down, and the heat rose as we continued toward Ledigos and Terradillos de los Templarios. Crissi and I were moving so fast that we realized we had left Bianca behind. We waited, but she must have taken a break earlier.",
          "Terradillos offered the first real shade since Calzadilla, and we joined a few other pilgrims at a stone picnic table for cold Cokes. Though it was technically a stage end, Crissi and I felt adventurous (or crazy) and decided to push on to Sahagún. We spent the next hour making bets on how far we had left, complaining about our jobs, and secretly plotting for something new in our lives.",
          "Finally, after a grueling downhill, we spotted Moratinos, then San Nicolás del Real Camino, and eventually reached Sahagún by 4 p.m. The Municipal Albergue, an old church, provided surprisingly good Wi-Fi, beds, and kitchen access. Exhausted from walking 39 kilometers, the longest stretch yet, we opted for a short exploration of the town, napped, and later grabbed a late dinner while catching part of the World Cup.",
          "Pain and exhaustion had set in, but the rhythm of the Camino was undeniable. Beyond a certain point, around 20 kilometers or so, the aches blend into a steady reminder of the distance traveled. Tomorrow promised a shorter stage toward Mansilla...hopefully.\n"
        ],
        "excerpt": "39 kilometers later, we arrived in Sahagún: exhausted, sunburned, and exhilarated. From Roman roads to stone picnic tables, the Wasteland tested us but the Camino's rhythm, shared jokes, and small victories kept us moving forward.",

          "Today started like all the others: rise early, beat the heat, and get walking. Our exit from Sahagún in the pre-dawn hours was quiet. Most pilgrims were still asleep, including Bianca, and the streets were empty as we passed through the arch of San Benito, following the familiar yellow arrows out of the city.",
          "The sun rose behind us as we quickly covered the first five kilometers to Calzada de Coto. Everything was closed, Mondays in Spain are treated like Sundays, but breakfast awaited at an Albergue in Calzadilla de los Hermanillos, about nine kilometers further. Fuel in our stomachs, we braced ourselves for the second longest Wasteland stretch of the Meseta, one no one had warned us about. Apparently, we were the only pilgrims who chose this route.",
          "Soon the paved road ended, and the Camino continued across endless flatlands on a dirt path. A single beat-up shoe marked the first trail sign. Ominous, but somehow fitting. We were walking on history now: Via Trajana, an ancient Roman road, stretching into the horizon. No shade, no water, nothing but sun, dirt, and the sound of our footsteps.",
          "Two hours in, a lone pilgrim overtook us, leaving us in her dust. Alone again, we pressed on. About two-thirds through the stretch, I lost sight of Crissi and panicked, but she was safely resting in a hidden patch of shade, water bottle empty. I gave her mine, knowing we had at least a few more kilometers to go.",
          "The landscape barely changed, dry fields and brown-red dirt, but finally, after nearly four hours, a line of trees appeared like a mirage. Salvation! Through the shade, we saw bulls feasting on potatoes, a surreal reward for enduring this barren stretch. Yet no town emerged immediately, and my water reserves dwindled. I pushed harder, ignoring signage and blazing sun.",
          "At last, a metallic pyramid atop a distant hill appeared like a lighthouse, guiding us to Reliegos. Relief and exhaustion collided. The paved road into town felt punishing after the dirt trail, and I collapsed on the curb. Crissi arrived shortly after, and we checked into an Albergue behind a bar.",
          "This stretch deserves the name The Wasteland. It was hotter, drier, and lonelier than the first. Nearly four hours of relentless sun, dirt, and zero shade tested every ounce of endurance. After a quiet dinner with fellow pilgrims Walter and Yo-yo from Holland, and a brief reunion with Luis, we collapsed into our bunks. Six beds, one bathroom, and a chorus of snorers couldn't compete with the deep, needed sleep after today's ordeal.",
          "Tomorrow, we hope to rest a bit, recharge, and finally leave the flatlands behind as we head for León.\n"
        ],
        "excerpt": "Four hours. No shade. No water. Relentless sun. The Wasteland tested us like nothing before. Relief came in the form of trees, a distant town, and the sight of familiar faces. Exhausted, sunburned, and alive, we collapsed into our Albergue ready to try again tomorrow.",

          "After days of relentless flat terrain, it felt glorious to sleep in. The sun was already up, and the other pilgrims had departed, but I was eager to get moving despite yesterday's lingering soreness. Our goal was León, and with it, to finally leave the endless Meseta behind.",
          "Cows kept us company on the approach to the old castle-fort city of Mansilla de las Mulas. As usual, nothing was open, but our pace didn't falter. The sun was not cooperating for photos, and then a bird decided to poop on my shirt. Chocolate, for anyone who asked. A badge of shame I wore the rest of the day.",
          "Finally, the hills returned! Small at first, but they broke up the endless horizon. Larger ones waited in the distance, teasing us with their challenge. Over the first hill: nothing, just more towns.",
          "Breakfast came at a quirky little bar in Villarmoros, hidden away in a town square patterned with white and yellow polka dots. They served fresh Spanish tortilla and bocadillos, and I indulged in both. From there, Villarente and Arcahuega fell quickly as we powered through 12 kilometers of highway, downtown streets, and occasional riverside paths.",
          "Construction diverted us into a more challenging route into León. The uphill stretch on pavement felt endless, but eventually led into the woods, and what a sight it was after the trees cleared. We raced down a dirt path onto a county road, following markers into the city. I always love the transition from modern to old towns, especially when you enter a walled city.",
          "Finding the Benedictine church Albergue proved tricky. We asked directions from at least three locals and added two extra kilometers before finally locating it. Crissi and I ventured out for food and found a bar serving 'rustic bread', thick slices topped with whatever they could dream up. It was so good we brought Bianca there too.",
          "Exploring León felt like a true tourist day. First, the cathedral: gothic, massive, and awe-inspiring. We convinced two other pilgrims to join us for the group ticket discount. Then a basilica, a Gaudí-designed house, and the city park. We ended the day with beers at a bar, people-watching, and a reunion with Ciro, who was limping badly after losing most of his toenails to his shoes. A stark reminder that the Camino leaves its mark in more ways than one.",
          "Dinner was a pilgrims menu at the restaurant next to the church, with a discount for staying at the Albergue. The walk today had been relatively easy, with plenty of stops for food, water, and rest. A welcomed reprieve before whatever tomorrow holds. Only two weeks remain until Santiago, and yet nights in places like Logroño and Nájera feel both centuries ago and just yesterday.\n"

        "excerpt": "After days of flat Meseta, the hills returned small, teasing, and glorious. Mansilla de las Mulas, Villarmoros, and finally León brought a mix of surprises: chocolate-bird shirts, rustic bread, Gothic cathedrals, and aching feet. Today was easier, but tomorrow? Who knows. Only two weeks remain until Santiago.",

          "Creaking beds and rustling backpacks served as an early morning alarm, and there was no snooze button in sight. We had been letting ourselves sleep in lately, but there was no complaint as we went through the usual routine: pack bags, grab toast and jam, brush teeth, and head out. Crissi was the last to join us in the courtyard, and soon we were walking.",
          "Stone streets glistened in the rising sun as we passed the cathedral, stopping quickly for coffee before leaving the old city center behind. It took most of the morning to make it out of León. The Way led us past scenic landmarks toward the Plaza de San Marcos and across the Rio Bernesga, before transitioning through industrial areas with fields of weeds opposite gray buildings. After a short uphill stretch along a busy highway, we finally reached Virgen del Camino, hungry and ready for a small roadside bar.",
          "For the day, we picked up a new companion, Kim from Australia, and faced a choice: stick to the highway or take the traditional scenic route. Memories of sunburns and warnings from other pilgrims made us hesitate, but the scenic route won out. It led us across scraggly patches of earth, under a highway underpass, through Fresno del Camino, and eventually into Oncina. There, a small church and a fountain offered a welcome break before the dirt path opened into fields surrounded by vegetation.",
          "The flat fields of the scenic route still had plenty to offer. Gently rolling terrain and clusters of green trees kept the walk interesting. The red dirt that had accompanied us for days was ever-present, but the sky was empty and the heat had yet to peak. Along the way, a spare pair of shoes on a trail marker caught my attention, but practicality won over curiosity. Chozas de Abajo appeared in the distance, providing a much-needed break at its only open establishment.",
          "While in town, I ran into Drew, whom I had met briefly in Pamplona, and soon after, Cerstin from Germany joined us. The conversation flowed as we discussed politics, culture, and Camino experiences. When it was time to pick an albergue, Casa de Jesus stood out with its swimming pool, a perfect respite from the relentless sun. After shopping for dinner, we sat together with other pilgrims, laughing over differences in culture, animal noises, and Camino stories.",
          "The day ended with a refreshing swim, followed by a shared dinner of salad, pasta with capers, and bread. Watching the gray clouds build in the distance, we prepared ourselves for another 30+ kilometer day. Despite the challenges and the heat, it felt comforting to see a table of friends slowly turning into family on this journey.\n"

          "I woke in the middle of the night to the sound of rain hitting the open windows, a sudden chill in the breeze reminding me it had arrived. Reluctantly, I shut the window closest to my bed, knowing the room would soon feel stuffy. The rain helped mask the snoring around me, and I fell back asleep. We had agreed to wake early to beat the heat, and a few hours later, I was up and getting ready.",
          "Walking out of the village in darkness, my head torch illuminated the straight, paved road ahead. The sun eventually broke free from thick clouds, casting light on endless farmlands as I zig-zagged along mud-filled dirt paths. Crissi's footprints guided me at times, but I pushed forward toward Villabente, passing lumber warehouses and train tracks along the way. The goal was Hospital de Orbigo, where I finally caught up with Crissi and convinced her to take the scenic route through hills and trees rather than the highway.",
          "The scenic route offered relief from the monotony of pavement. Red dirt paths stretched endlessly through forests and fields, dotted with strange insects and rolling hills. We stopped at Casa de Los Dioses, a trail angel's home offering free food, drinks, and shaded seating. Signatures from pilgrims lined the house walls, and the host's humor added a memorable touch to the stop. Soon after, we caught glimpses of Astorga from a hilltop cross and passed through San Justo de la Vega on our way into the city.",
          "Navigating the train track ramps into Astorga tested patience, but we finally arrived at a five-euro albergue with amazing views from the top floor. The amenities were basic at best. No outlets near the beds, scalding hot showers, tiny toilet stalls, and poor air circulation. But the price and location made it worthwhile. After a quick gear repack, I felt the first real pangs in my knee and picked up a brace along with some cream for an infected finger, both of which were lifesavers for the rest of the Camino.",
          "In the evening, Cerstin invited me to dinner with other pilgrims. We shared pancakes and \"real\" German Kriek beer, laughing and bonding over food and stories. Outside, another storm rolled through, soaking clothes hung to dry and reminding us how unpredictable the weather can be. Despite the heat and humidity in our room, spirits were high because tomorrow marked a return to the mountains, and the terrain ahead promised a change from flat roads and red dirt.\n"

        "excerpt": "Rain greeted me in the night, and by morning, the Camino led through red dirt paths, forests, and rolling hills toward Astorga. A trail angel's home, a scenic route, and a lively dinner with fellow pilgrims made the day both challenging and unforgettable.",

          "Sleep was elusive in the hot, stale attic dormitory. The faint echoes from the bathrooms below forced us to close the door, cutting off the only airflow that kept the room tolerable. Two small gable windows barely helped, and by 6 a.m., vibrations from a nearby pillow pulled me out of what little rest I had managed. Gear packed and ready, I joined the others in the landing outside our room and we quietly roused the rest of the building as we prepared to leave.",
          "Without breakfast available at the albergue, we headed out into the early morning streets, making a quick stop at an ATM before walking past the cathedral and out of the city. A tree-lined road led us over a highway toward Murias de Rechivaldo, before farm fields stretched ahead toward Santa Catalina de Somoza and our breakfast at Albergue El Caminante. White gravel paths ran alongside black roads, bordered by green trees and patches of rock, forming the landscape for most of our morning.",
          "A surprising encounter awaited at a small turn into the woods. A man dressed as a knight in chainmail offered donations for Asociación Gaudisse, complete with a tame hawk perched nearby. Each of us took a turn meeting the bird, marveling at its calm demeanor. After this playful detour, the path led uphill through uneven earthen trails and the trees, eventually bringing us into Rabanal del Camino. Here, persistence paid off as we discovered The Green Garden, a shaded oasis with chaise lounges, friendly dogs and cats, and cheap ice cream. While tempting to camp here under the stars, the outdoor bathroom convinced us otherwise.",
          "The next leg of the walk was a steep scramble over rocks and rough terrain, which Cerstin aptly dubbed \"Auf Stein,\" meaning up stone. The sounds of the nearby road were a reminder that nature's serenity was fleeting, yet the small shelter with a natural fountain offered refreshing relief. Hours later, we reached Foncebadón, a town of crumbling ruins alongside new construction, a reminder of the Camino's enduring revival. The Druid-themed albergue welcomed us, reuniting us with friends we had lost along the way.",
          "Dinner was a simple burger across the street, while the World Cup played on and clouds obscured the sunset. Standing on the grassy hill behind the albergue, watching the towns we had passed through light up, was humbling. Thoughts turned to tomorrow and the Cruz de Ferro, where pilgrims leave stones symbolizing burdens carried since the start of the Camino. The anticipation of sunrise and the ritual of release made the climb worth every exhausting step.\n"
        ],
        "excerpt": "The Camino led us through gravel paths, farm fields, and uphill rock scrambles to the village of Foncebadón, where ruins and new construction coexist. The day ended with a Druid-themed albergue, reflective hills, and anticipation for the Cruz de Ferro.",

          "Watching the sunrise is an effortlessly beautiful experience. It only takes a few minutes, but it can feel like an eternity. Waking up early has become second nature for our group, originally a strategy to avoid the hottest parts of the day, but now simply the rhythm of the Camino. Today's journey would take us past Cruz de Ferro, home to a growing pile of rocks that carries deep symbolic meaning for pilgrims.",
          "Cruz de Ferro sits atop a hill, and pilgrims traditionally leave a small stone there to symbolize mental or emotional burdens. I quickly added my own rock to the pile, though it didn't feel as momentous as I had expected. The paved road led us to the cross, but the trail continued over the hill and down the backside, a slow and awkward descent reminiscent of early days on the Camino. The knee brace I was wearing proved its worth immediately.",
          "Our path took us through rolling green hills that gradually transformed into rocky mountains. We stopped in Manjarín, a small town where an old man claimed to be the last of the Templars. His humble stone home, partly carved into the rock, was adorned with fascinating artifacts, offering a glimpse into a storied past. Breakfast followed in El Acebo, though a minor seating dispute taught us quickly that shade isn't always free.",
          "After nearly all downhill walking for another hour and a half, we reached a town with a cold river, perfect for resting our feet. A short walk later brought us to Ponferrada, where the heat was relentless and the albergue offered little relief. Despite the stifling conditions, we managed to get laundry done, buy ingredients for dinner, and take a tour of the restored Templar Castle. Walking through its rooms and passages gave a sense of history and scale, even if the interiors were mostly props.",
          "A small café outside the castle offered a brief respite before we retreated to the albergue for reading, chatting, and a homemade meal. The combination of sun, hills, history, and camaraderie made the day exhausting yet deeply rewarding. Even in the heat, the Camino continues to surprise and challenge, one step at a time.\n"

        "excerpt": "We passed Cruz de Ferro and left our stones, a symbolic gesture for burdens carried along the Camino. The day ended in Ponferrada with a tour of a restored Templar Castle and a relaxing evening at the albergue.",

          "Another hot day on the Camino started with a mishap: I realized I had left my food back at the albergue and had to double back, meaning I would be walking alone for most of the day. Once I finally left the city, the route followed the river and soon led into the countryside. The first town I passed was too early for breakfast, so I pushed through, snacking on a banana I had brought along while listening to music as the farmlands rolled by.",
          "Fuentesnuevas passed without incident, and Camponaraya offered a small cafe and juice stand where I stopped for orange juice and a short break. I spent some time planning accommodations for the day's final town, catching my breath before pressing on. Cacabellos featured interesting Egyptian-style wall art, but I found no place to rest or eat. Lunch only came in Piero, where a quiet Donativo spot allowed me to eat my sandwich while watching the road, hoping to catch up with friends, but they never appeared.",
          "Villafranca del Bierzo marked the stage end for the day. I took a scenic detour off the road, which made the journey far more pleasant than worrying about traffic. The municipal albergue was closed, so I headed to Albergue Leo, instantly falling in love with the cozy space. Soon after, I reconnected with my friends, and together we explored the town, grabbed food, and later reunited with the girls from Texas for an afternoon of swimming in the Rio Burbia, skipping stones, and enjoying the summer heat.",
          "The day ended quietly back at the albergue with some card games to pass the time. The heat had been relentless, reaching nearly 100°F, so we took refuge indoors and prepared for the next day: our earliest departure yet, leaving before 5 a.m. Despite the solo start, the day ended with laughter, friendship, and a perfect afternoon by the river, a reminder of the small joys the Camino offers.\n"

          "Crissi and I left Villafranca before the sun even considered rising, walking faster than we ever had towards the mountains. Moving through the dark at that hour is magical: the air feels alive, the streets are silent, and the only visible stretch is the path illuminated by our footsteps. We passed through Pereje, where a fellow pilgrim was heading back to Villafranca, clearly having forgotten something. I could relate.",
          "Our route took us under and over highways, along wooded river paths, and past rock faces held in place by cages of wire. We reached Trabadelo early, but everything was closed for the Monday morning, so we pressed on, passing small towns until breakfast at a hotel cafe in Ambasmestas. On the way to Herrerias, we encountered a surprisingly talkative duck, though it wasn't much for conversation. Herrerias marked the last town before the mountain ascent, and we decided to continue without waiting for those behind us.",
          "The climb started on a steep road and transitioned to a dirt path, the steepest portion yet. We left a small stone message for our friend Maddy at a Camino marker, though she never saw it directly, learning about it later through others. The ascent through thick forest protected us from the sun, and we passed many pilgrims before taking a brief rest in La Faba. A local farm family released their bulls and donkey into the streets during our pause, a sight that felt entirely unexpected.",
          "Laguna was our next milestone, and we sped up again, grabbing cokes and watching others arrive at the top. From there, a gradually rising trail led to O'Cebreiro. Along the way, we crossed into Galicia, entering the autonomous region of Santiago de Compostela. The views at O'Cebreiro are breathtaking: rolling hills and mountains stretch as far as the eye can see.",
          "The albergue at O'Cebreiro is basic. Showers lacked curtains, beds were stacked close together, and the town itself felt touristy with gift shops and a small museum church. Once everyone arrived, we grabbed drinks together and shared stories. Luis had the toughest journey, navigating three major hills and bushwhacking his way after a wrong turn. Dinner was simple, and we hoped the municipal albergue wouldn't be too stuffy overnight.\n"

          "Galicia feels like paradise, and we ended up covering nearly two stages in one day to avoid another scorching afternoon. A few of us left together in darkness, the fog so thick that our headlamps barely lit the path immediately in front of us. Hiking through the forest with fog curling around the trees was a little eerie, but also mesmerizing. Along the way, we stopped at a statue dedicated to pilgrims atop another mountain, its silhouette rising from the shadows like something out of a dream. Two towns passed quietly: Hospital de la Condesa and Padornelo, completely dark and silent, with only passing cars reminding us of the nearby road.",
          "As the sun rose, the sky transformed. Clouds ahead shifted from pale gray to brilliant whites and soft pinks, while the clouds behind us glowed as if set on fire. We reached Alto do Poio for a much-needed break and food. A huge dog demanded attention, resting its massive paw on my arm, and I would have fed it table scraps if the owner hadn't called it away. Meanwhile, Crissi and Mauro drifted into a deep conversation as I lagged behind, stopping to capture the breathtaking mix of moss, stones, trees, and fog during my descent alone.",
          "By noon, we had arrived in Triacastela, although the three castles that gave the town its name are long gone. Breakfast was quick, and we collectively decided to press on, grateful that the towns ahead would provide new scenery rather than sitting idle in an empty town so early in the day. Along the way, we met Eileen from New Zealand, whose near-perfect Spanish impressed everyone, and she joined us for the rest of the mountain descent. Crissi and Mauro seemed to fly down the trail, while I struggled to keep pace. Midway, I pulled something in my ankle, inflaming a tendon, and had to slow my pace considerably.",
          "Luis caught up with us as we entered Sarria, and I relied on my trekking poles as makeshift crutches. Before ascending the stairs into the city, we stopped at a pharmacy for a compression sock and tendon cream, with Crissi kindly helping translate. Finally, we arrived at a charming albergue along the main road around 5 p.m., relieved to find showers with privacy and a welcoming space to rest. That evening, we shared another family-style dinner while watching the Nigeria vs. Argentina soccer game.",
          "Sarria marks the beginning point for pilgrims who only have a week to walk the Camino. Reaching it makes the finish feel tantalizingly close, yet also makes every step we've taken so far feel deeply rewarding.\n"
        ],
        "excerpt": "We raced through dense fog and stunning mountain landscapes, descending into Galicia faster than expected. By afternoon, we reached Sarria, the gateway for week-long pilgrims, relieved to find a cozy albergue and time to rest.",

          "This is the second time I've had to say goodbye to people I had grown close to. It feels surreal to think that we are almost at the end: only three more days until Santiago. Today we parted ways with our group. Louis pushed on, completing two stages in a single day, while Maddy, Cerstin, and Isabelle took it easy and stayed at the previous stage. Mauro and Eileen continued on to Gonzar, and Crissi and I chose to remain in Pontemarion.",
          "I knew these moments were part of the Camino, but experiencing them first-hand was something else entirely. To become so connected to people you share laughter, pain, and memories with is a unique experience. The bonds formed along the trail are something I have never truly felt before. As strange as it sounds, I can already see myself doing this all over again.",
          "Today's walk was relatively easy. I took it slow because of my right ankle tendon issues, but the compression sock kept things manageable. Crossing another small mountain on the way out of Sarria, the forests and tiny villages passed by almost in a blur. We stopped for breakfast at a small cafe outside Morgade, and shortly after, we reached the 100-kilometer marker.",
          "Pontemarion appeared ahead, and we chose the safer approach into town. The alternative route went down old dirt and brick steps and was recommended only for those in excellent shape. Once in town, Crissi and I decided to stay while Eileen and Mauro continued onward. Settling into a bar, we quickly realized how much we already missed their company.",
          "During dinner, we entertained the idea of taking a two-day trip to Porto, Portugal, just to make use of the extra time we had. We had been pushing through stages with energy and focus, and figured everyone else would be too far ahead or behind to meet again.",
          "Regardless of our plans, we are excited to celebrate the Fourth of July from Fisterra, Spain, knowing that the last days of this journey are fast approaching. The memories of these friendships and the trail itself will stay with me long after we reach Santiago.\n"
        ],
        "excerpt": "Saying goodbye to friends on the Camino is harder than I expected, even after months of walking together. Crissi and I stayed in Pontemarion while others pushed on, and we already missed their company.",

          "Walking through Roman ruins after being reunited with a traveling companion is an experience you don't pass up. Our hosts decided to turn on the lights at 6 a.m., giving everyone a rude awakening and causing minor chaos in the dormitory. We packed up quickly and retraced our steps over the bridge to get back on the Camino. This town wasn't even on the original route anymore, having been relocated to higher ground after a historic flood.",
          "The morning hike took us uphill past corn storage houses and through the charred remains of a forest. Ninety minutes later, we arrived in Castromaior after passing through Gonzar. The albergue there had a restaurant, which was a lifesaver since we were starving. Walking in, we were greeted by Eileen, a fellow pilgrim we had said goodbye to only the day before. It felt like pure fate to be reunited so quickly, and we enjoyed breakfast together before continuing our trek.",
          "Shortly after leaving Castromaior, we came across the ruins of a Roman encampment. Walking among the ancient structures and seeing remnants of kitchens and bathrooms was incredible. Being able to reach out and touch history in a way you rarely can back home was humbling. We paused again to wait for Eileen outside Hospital Alta da Cruz before heading to Palas de Rei, where a solid lunch fueled our decision to \"turn on Beast Mode\" and push for Melide, about 14 kilometers away.",
          "The walk to Melide was challenging, but full of laughter and conversation. Just as we reached the outskirts of town, we spotted Mauro leaving a handwritten note on the bridge, telling us to meet him in town. Seeing his note felt like a perfect, whimsical moment after such a long day of walking.",
          "Once in Melide, we found a great place to stay with a green backyard, and later ran into Sam, who is finishing the Camino with a hefty 40-pound backpack. Dinner was a highlight: Pulpo a la Gallega, a local specialty of boiled octopus with olive oil, paprika, bread, and white wine. Every bite felt like a reward.",
          "The day was full of unexpected joy. Being reunited with familiar faces, discovering historical sites, and savoring local food reminded me of why the Camino continues to be such a meaningful journey.\n"

          "Today was the last official day of walking the Camino Frances in full, and anticipation hung in the air. After nearly 45 kilometers of walking in a single day, we all took a late start. Our first stop was Boente for breakfast, where we hoped for a priestly blessing but settled for the required stamp instead. These stamps are essential for earning the certificate at the end of the journey, and getting two per day has become routine.",
          "The trail passed through several small towns, each blending together as the sun climbed higher. The heat was intense, and the beginnings of sunburn were inevitable. We arrived in Arzúa after a couple of hours, and then continued on to Arca, also known as O Pedrouzo, around 5 p.m. It was a slow day compared to other stages, but over 30 kilometers still left us physically spent. A light rain threatened as we tried to reconnect with Eileen and Mauro via free WiFi at a local bar.",
          "Finding accommodations proved to be a challenge. After trying four different places, we finally secured beds at a hotel/albergue called Porta de Santiago. Eileen and Mauro joined us there, and it felt good to be reunited after a long day on the trail. The place was comfortable and reasonably priced, which was a relief after the day's long trek.",
          "With a concert happening in Santiago this weekend, we quickly realized that hostels and albergues were filling up fast. Following Eileen's advice, we started looking into reservations but ended up deciding to wing it, trusting that things would work out.",
          "As we settled in for the night, I couldn't help but feel the weight of the month-long journey coming to a close. Tomorrow we would reach Santiago, the city that had been on our minds for nearly thirty days, and the sense of accomplishment was already beginning to sink in.\n"

        "excerpt": "The last full day on the Camino Frances was long, slow, and filled with small towns and scenic trails. With Santiago just a day away, excitement and anticipation were impossible to ignore.",

          "I could hardly believe that we had finally reached Santiago. Our destination, which had always seemed so far away, was now in front of us after so many days and miles of walking. The morning began with a torrential downpour that felt like a fan blasting on my face. Maybe it was fitting that the start of our final day would be accompanied by such heavy rain.",
          "Fortunately, the rain eased as we walked. Most of the morning was spent moving through wet fields, shaded forests, and past longhorn oxen. We stopped briefly at Monte de Gozo to see the monument and catch our first glimpse of the cathedral towers in the distance. With each step into the city, the crowd of fellow pilgrims grew, all following the yellow arrows in silent determination toward the plaza. Bagpipes welcomed us through the old city tunnel, a Celtic tradition that added a mystical quality to our entrance.",
          "Arriving in the plaza, I stood before the cathedral in disbelief. After so many days and miles, this was it. We took photos, shared hugs, and then collected our Compostelas, the official certificates marking the completion of the Camino. The reality sank in: the journey was over. There would be no walking tomorrow, just rest and time to explore the city.",
          "We attended the Pilgrim Mass, which was entirely in Spanish, and watched the enormous incense burner swing dramatically over the congregation. Later, we celebrated at a local tapas restaurant with Crissi, Cerstin, Mauro, and Bianca, the original group from Hontanas. It felt strange not to worry about waking up early for another day on the trail.",
          "As night fell, Crissi, Mauro, and I returned to the cathedral. Its grandeur in the quiet of evening was overwhelming. Standing there, reflecting on the journey, I nearly felt tears welling up. I hugged Crissi tightly and thanked her simply: for the companionship, support, laughter, and shared experiences. Without her, this incredible journey would not have been possible.",
          "Tomorrow we will head to Finisterre, to see the zero mile marker and continue our small postscript to the Camino. But tonight, I allowed myself to simply stand in awe, grateful for every step that led me here.\n"
        ],
        "excerpt": "After weeks on the Camino, Santiago finally appeared on the horizon. The cathedral plaza, bagpipes, and hugs made the completion feel surreal and unforgettable.",

          "A full month had passed since we started this journey back in France, a month that now felt like a different world. We left Santiago de Compostela in the early morning rain, pausing just long enough to steal one final glance at the cathedral over the hills. The streets were mostly empty, and a few early pilgrims were beginning to arrive as we made our way through the plaza and out of the city. It was fitting that the start of this next chapter would be accompanied by rain, quiet, and reflection.",
          "Our path quickly led us into forests and rolling hills surrounding the city. The ascent was steady but never harsh, winding through small villages and hamlets tucked into the greenery. Rivers traced our steps, and the canopy of trees provided shelter from the drizzle. It was a day full of natural beauty, with each bend in the trail revealing another peaceful view of northern Galicia.",
          "We arrived at Ponte Maceira, a town perched above the Río Tambre. The medieval bridge here was fascinating to explore, and we waited patiently for the small riverside restaurant that would provide our first stamp toward the Finisterre certificate. While our choice of a leftover fish empanada was less than ideal, the scenery and fresh air quickly erased any lingering regrets, and we pressed on along the trail.",
          "Negreira was our destination for the day, an uphill journey that rewarded us with beautiful vistas and a lively town. We quickly settled into an Albergue perched above a bar and enjoyed a surprisingly cheap lunch of burgers, fries, and beer. In the quiet hours before dinner, I wandered the streets alone, discovering clothing shops and grocery stores in a town that felt busier than its size might suggest. Eventually, we regrouped to enjoy ice cream, dinner, and a soccer game, blending casual indulgence with Camino camaraderie.",
          "Despite the rain and the long hours, it felt good to be back on the trail. Walking after a day off gave me a renewed sense of purpose, and while I was eager to reach the end at Finisterre, I also wished the journey could last forever. Every hill, forest, and village made it clear that the Camino's magic is as much in the steps as it is in the destination.\n"

        "excerpt": "We left Santiago in the early morning rain, ready to continue toward Finisterre. The forests, rivers, and small villages made the day feel both peaceful and alive, a perfect start to the final leg of the Camino.",

          "Rain followed me for most of the day, but it didn't bother me at all. In fact, the mist and low-hanging clouds put me in an almost meditative mood. Day four of rain in the mornings and probably only the third day of the Camino with a full day of precipitation didn't dampen my spirits. As long as my shoes stayed dry, I was happy. The goal today was Santa Mariña, about 25 kilometers away, but we weren't in a rush now that we knew we had time to spare.",
          "Walking alone gave me the chance to take my time and wander off the trail for photos. Old stone houses, grazing sheep, and quiet roads surrounded me. I even chatted, or tried to, with the local dogs, though they were indifferent at best. At A Peña, I reunited with Mauro and Crissi after a brief stop at a café. A fellow pilgrim offered me some of his leftover Spanish tortilla, which I gratefully accepted. It felt like an obvious choice; wasting food here would be a crime, and we had fully embraced our inner scavengers.",
          "The trek continued through the rain for several hours. Santa Mariña itself was small and uninspiring, with the constant smell of cow pastures lingering in the air. After a short break, I decided to press on, music cranked in my headphones, leaving Crissi and Mauro to fall behind as I walked toward Olveiroa. I eventually paused in Mallón to let them catch up, grabbing some orange juice at a local bar while waiting.",
          "Once reunited, we continued following a group of Texans we had seen along the way, determined to finish the stage in one go. By mid-afternoon we arrived in Olveiroa. After checking out a cheaper Albergue and finding it lacking, we opted for a slightly more expensive option that promised more comfort.",
          "Evening brought some welcome relaxation. We met the Texans at a nearby restaurant, played card games, and watched football. Dinner was simple, and the mood was mellow, but it felt good to pause after a long day of wet walking. Tomorrow, we were planning to head for the ocean towns of Cee and Corcubón, ready for the next chapter of this final stretch.\n"

        "excerpt": "Rain, mist, and quiet roads set the tone as we walked to Santa Mariña and beyond. Music, wandering, and unexpected tortilla made the day peaceful and surprisingly joyful.",

          "We decided to combine multiple stages and finish the Camino together. The morning began with an epic sunrise as we left Olveiroa, walking through the mist toward Hospital. Breakfast at a small café gave us time to rest, but shortly after, the choice became clear: Fisterra or Muxía. Mauro joined us, and soon we were hiking through forests and hills, catching our first glimpses of the ocean and the towns of Cee and Corcubión. Along the way, we picked up Anna from Hungary, a new walking companion who would share in our final stretch.",
          "The walk along the bay was stunning, even if we got briefly lost and had to make our own path to reconnect with the Camino. Lunch was simple: sandwiches from yesterday enjoyed at the water's edge, but the moment was unforgettable. Saying goodbye to friends along the way was bittersweet, yet Crissi and I felt a sudden spark of determination: we would keep going and reunite with them. Within an hour, we found ourselves at the beach near Estorde, spotting Anna in the distance. The small detour to rest and have coffee turned into a magical moment of reunion.",
          "Finally, Fisterra appeared on the horizon. Walking into town, the sun emerged, illuminating the path to the 0 km marker, the official end of the Camino. Arriving there was overwhelming. We walked up to the lighthouse, claimed our spots on the rocks, and sat in silence for nearly an hour, staring out at the vast ocean. I reflected on everything that had brought me here, letting awe and gratitude wash over me. It was the true end of the journey, a final punctuation mark to a month-long adventure.",
          "Reunions continued as Mauro joined us on the rocks, and we headed back into town to find accommodation. After several full Albergues, we ended up at a Hungarian-owned hostel, sharing a room with Anna and later spotting Cerstin. Dinner with friends, a walk along the \"hippy\" beach, and even glimpses of dolphins made the evening feel surreal. Words cannot fully capture the magic of this day or the friendships formed along the Camino.",
          "The next morning, July 5th, brought final goodbyes to everyone as they caught buses back to Santiago and onward home. Crissi and I spent the day walking along the beach, collecting shells, exploring Fisterra, visiting the pilgrim museum, and returning to our favorite restaurant. At night, we sat in the plaza, watching the sun set over the place we had dreamed of reaching.",
          "July 7th, 2018, marked my final departure. Crissi left early to catch her train, and we exchanged one last hug and words of thanks. Alone, I boarded the bus for the airport, reflecting on the Camino's lessons, the people I met, and the journey that will stay with me forever. I left Spain with a full heart and the promise to return someday.\n"

It was a long day on the water (nearly 10 hours round trip), but absolutely worth it.",

This glacier has been retreating steadily for decades, which makes seeing its remaining blue ice even more poignant. There were icebergs floating in the lagoon that were so blue they looked fake.",

          "After soaking in the city sights for a couple of days, I geared up for a guided day hike into the Andes mountains just outside of Santiago. The group ended up being a smaller one, resulting in a laid-back excursion with just me and my friend, an adventurous elderly couple from the Netherlands, and two enthusiastic guides.",
          "This was my first time hiking in the mountains, like, actual mountains. Coming from flat Chicago where the landscape is more pancake than peak, and being at the highest elevation I had ever been at, I wasn't fully prepared (physically) for this.",
          "As we gained elevation I found myself needing more and more breaks in order to catch my breath. Along the way we came to a massive rock that had been split open, and on the inside were prehistoric fossils from the pre-cambrian era. This was my first time seeing fossils outside of a musem.",
          "We quenched our thirst with ice-cold glacier melt water from a nearby mountain stream, and it was the most refreshing thing ever. Finally, after navigating past a small false summit, our lead guide extended his hand and said 'Congrats, you made it.' And there it was, a stunning glacier, melting into a muddy-brown mountain lake. It was so quite up there, so serene.",
          "I had never laid eyes on a glacier outside of books and films. The silence up there was almost magical; the only sound was the occasional cracking sound coming from the glacier itself. We settled onto rocks and gazed in wonder at the glacier while enjoying our food with a view. Our lead guide even surprised us by playing their flute.\n"

        "excerpt": "I did my first hike in the Andes just outside Santiago, and after a challenging climb, we were rewarded with the serene sight of a glacier and a peaceful mountain lake. Ice-cold glacier melt water and a flute playing in the silence made the experience unforgettable.",

Getting out of central Santiago and into the Maipo Valley was surprisingly easy with little traffic, but we also cheated by using another local guide who merely provided the transportation for us. But it did feel a little less touristy.",
          "We started at Cousiño Macul, one of the oldest family-owned vineyards in the country, located right on the edge of the city. The grounds are stunning. It felt like stepping back in time. We joined in with a winery tour and learned a lot about the history of the place, and the history of wine in Chile. We walked through the beautiful vineyards with the Andes in the background, visited the old cellars, and learned how the winemaking process has evolved. The premium tasting was well worth the extra cost.",

The highlight, of course, was the famous 'Casillero del Diablo' (Devil's Cellar) legend. The tour guides put on a great little show, and the atmosphere in the spooky, dimly lit cellar was really fun.\n"
