I finally finished watching it the other day though, just for the sake of being a completionist.\n",

It’s frequently treated as a final checklist item instead of something that should be baked in from the start. And that’s a mistake; it’s way harder to retrofit accessibility than it is to design with it in mind from day one.\n\nIt’s its own challenge entirely, and one that deserves way more attention earlier in the process.\n",
