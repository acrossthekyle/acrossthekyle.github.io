      "Considered to be the most difficult of all trails in Europe, the GR 20 (or French High Route) is a footpath that traverses the Mediterranean island of Corsica from north to south along its spiny mountainous backbone, reaching a maximum altitude of 8,550 feet. It demanded thousands of feet of elevation change every day, totally 44,475 ft of gain and 44,549 ft of loss. Between the northern starting point at Calenzana to the finish at Conca in the south, there were hidden mountain lakes, expansive sea views, rugged and rocky cliffs, and remarkable panoramas.",

          "I arrived on the island of Corsica yesterday, after many connecting flights, from Chicago, and a short taxi ride from the airport near Calenzana, my starting point for this trek. I grabbed a quick dinner with some other hikes who were staying at the same Gîte, and then settled in for a restless night of sleep in anticipation of starting the trek early tomorrow morning. I can't wait to be back in the mountains.",
          "I nearly quit on the first day.",
          "The windows had been left open all night to keep a breeze going due to the mid-summer heat, and it was comfortable but still warm in the room. So, with little sleep, I began packing up. I ate a simple breakfast of yogurt with cereal, a banana, and some bread and butter that I had purchased yesterday at the local grocery store. I started the thru-hike at 6:30am.",
          "The trail started going up right away, and it didn’t hold back. While this wasn't a high elevation I was having trouble catching my breath due to all of the steps up on the various switchbacks. Admittedly, I had not done any training other than taking my dog Dax for walks along the lake, and maybe the occasional treadmill workout. Big mistake. My Garmin watch told me all I needed to know: my heart rate was staying steadily in the \"endurance\" zone, 5 of 5. I took a break at every turn or corner in the trail in order to catch my breath.",
          "But all this didn't stop me from taking as many pictures as I could.",
          "After two and a half hours of marching upwards I reached a Col and saw that the trail was starting to go down, and staying level. This didn't last long though, and upon ending the initial descent through the trees the trail started to go back up again, but only this time it decided to throw in something new: scrambling. Did I stretch this morning? Of course not.",
          "More scrambling and climbing up rocks. Eventually the trail came to a bald on a mountain and I could see my destination for the night in the distance. There were more ups and downs in order to reach the Refuge but they weren't bad, and didn't last long. I made it to the refuge and found a spot to pitch my tent for the night. It was exposed to the elements (no shade or vegetation) but that was the way this particular Refuge was set up.",
          "There's a lot of people here, it's going to be busy on the trail, and at the refuges, but that's good: more opportunities to make friends. Oh, and there's tons of little lizards running around, plus three cows who keep tramping through the area with the tents. I hope they steer clear of mine.",
          "I had a really fulfilling dinner with people from Germany (Denis), Netherlands (Peter and Tyezet), and Belgium (Charlie and Sophie). We would end up walking and camping together for the next 9 days."

On this trip I had brought a mini thermometer with me so that I could keep track of how well my sleep system would perform based on the various temperatures throughout the trip.",
          "I woke early to comfortable temperatures in order to catch the sunrise but there wasn't much to see: it was hidden behind a ridge of mountains. I set about packing up my gear, and getting ready for the day. Breakfast was a standard European breakfast: yogurt, bread, and jam/nutella.",

There were some sketchy areas were you had to boulder across severe drops with no chains.",

          "Once at the top it was time to go down over steep drops, and over rough rock. From up here though we can still see the coast, and Calenzana. We ate lunch on an exposed rocky platform where we could see the place we were staying at tonight far, far, down below.",
          "The journey down from the top took about one and a half hours, but it was a lot more pleasant today than it was yesterday; it was mostly through forests but the trees were large, very large, and spaced out so that a nice breeze could make its way in. After several switchbacks and multiple choose-your-own- adventure trail sections we made it to the bottom. Some of our group had booked rooms in the hotel, and the rest of us were camping. I found a good flat tent spot with a nice amount of shade.",
          "I'm a vegetarian, mostly, but when someone told me they had fries and a burger, I rushed over to the restaurant at the hotel. It was so good, hit the spot. Afterwards I took a nice much needed nap in the cool summer breeze.",
          "I ordered a fancy buffet breakfast at the hotel next to the camping area because the breakfasts at the refuges aren't that fulfilling. It's supposed to be a long day tomorrow, so I'm going to try and wake up early, around 5:00 am."

          "Today was the longest day so far on trail in terms of mileage and time. The breakfast buffet at the hotel was amazing, and definitely needed. I filled up on eggs, sausage, and so much bread. With a full belly I packed up my stuff and hit the trail.",
          "Since we had dropped a fair amount of elevation yesterday when arriving at Ascu Stagnu, it meant we had to go up right away after leaving the campsite, but it was through a lovely forest with clear views of the world around, and the trail was very well maintained. There was one big river crossing, but I hopped between the rocks with ease as I crossed it. Once I was out of the trees it was time to start the hard part of todays hike: going up to the highest point on the whole thru-hike. This meant lots of climbing up rocks, and using chains to assist when they were provided.",
          "Lots of people were struggling to get up the areas that had chains, and weren't using them to their full advantage. As I got higher and higher I had to start moving slower and slower. I was hiking through mountains now and loving it. The areas that needed chains started to become less frequent, and the trail transitioned to part rocky path part climbing over rocky obstacles. About 90 minutes later and I was at the first of two cols today, the latter of which would be the highest point on the thru-hike.",
          "I stopped to explore the plateau and found a waterfall within a short walking distance and filled up on water. It was really buggy there, so I didn't stay long.",
          "Once back on trail it would take about another 90 minutes to reach the high point for today. On the way there the trail did a bunch of switchbacking on loose scree, and we had to walk over snow patches here and there. The part just below the top had fresh snowmelt flowing down it which made it super slippery, and there were no chains in this area. Combine that with a bunch of scrambling and climbing in this area and it was a tough job getting to the top.",
          "Amazing views from up there! I'm as high as the clouds are right now. I could see the rest of the trail on this high portion in the distance, and it didn't seem that far, but the way down was tricky. There were some areas that were nice and wide and flat, and other areas that you could only get a single toe on as you had to walk across this near-vertical wall of rock. It was nerve-racking.",
          "After making it through the tricky part, the trail now began going down loose scree and sandy dirt-like materials. The ground underfoot was slippery, and it would take about two hours to make it down.",
          "I made it to Auberge U Vallone by mid-afternoon. This was a nice little place that had good views on their front dining area. I checked in, ordered dinner/breakfast, and then went to find a spot to set up my tent. I found a good spot, with trees for hanging my clothing line so that I could air and dry my stuff out. The showers were nice and hot as well.",
          "There was a small waterfall with a tidal pool right next to the Auberge, and lots of people were taking advantage of its ice cold waters to go swimming or dip their feet in.",
          "I had veal for the first time for dinner that night. It's amazing how fast I've become non-vegetarian on this hike, and with Corsican cuisine. It tasted good though, and I didn't feel ill afterwards or anything like that.",
          "I'm starting to get some blisters on both of my feet. I wrapped them with the gauze I had brought as best I could. These toe socks I chose to wear for this hike are not so good, and I'm going to stick with Darn Tough from now on. And some stronger hiking shoes. I don't know what happened to the quality of Altra shoes but these trail runners are already falling apart."

          "Today would be easier than yesterday, as I filled myself up with a breakfast of hot chocolate, and bread-n-butter. I was able to move quite fast today as we left the Auberge. The trail went along a rocky trail as it curved its way through the trees around us, and provided lots of lookout points for us to enjoy the large expansive forested valley below. Several trees littered the ground, as we crossed over small rivers fed by waterfalls.",
          "About 30 minutes later the trail turned from dirt to rock and began ascending up the steep mountainside as I took more frequent breaks on the way up. Luckily my knees were still doing great, but one of the knee pads' velcro was starting to fail.",
          "About halfway up we stopped at a large waterfall and filled up our bottles, and soaked our hats in the ice-cold water. Such a refreshing feeling!",
          "We made it to the top of the col, and finished the hardest part of the trail today by 9:00 am. Amazingly the Mediterranean Sea is still visible from these high-up points. There is a refuge up here called Refuge Miori and we stopped there to take a break. I had my first Orangina sugary drink, like a Fanta they say, but on steroids. Regardless, it was delicious and gave me a nice boost of energy.",
          "The trail coming down from Refuge Miori was relatively easy. It was mostly dirt, and had a nice easing slope to it. We passed a pair of cows chilling in the bushes as we made our way down. Near the bottom I paused and looked back, wow, such an amazing sight seeing how far we'd come in just 60 minutes.",
          "Up ahead were a series of cascading waterfalls, and one of these cascading areas had a large flat rocky entrance, which we decided to take full advantage of and stripped down to our underwear and went swimming in. Oh man was it cold, but such a refreshing feeling!",
          "As we continued on our way a herd of goats led by their owners started coming down a steep mountainside and onto the trail. We were delayed for a short while and had to move slowly as the goats made their way, and their owners tried to herd them away.",
          "After passing the goats we crossed a bridge and about 10 minutes later came to a small food stand that was selling cheese-filled pancakes and lasagna. We grabbed a table in the shade and treated ourselves to some of those cheese-filled pancakes, and they were delicious!",
          "We continued on through lush green forests and I ended up speeding through parts of the trail. Once at the hotel we settled in and busted out a deck of cards to pass the time.",
          "I bought some flip flops at the hiker shop for wearing around camp. The ones I had brought with me weighed nothing and were super thin, which was great for keeping my pack weight down, but they were too thin for walking around on this rough terrain at the campsites.",
          "This was the biggest and most delicious dinner of the trip so far. Steak with fries and egg salad, and dessert!",
          "Tomorrow promises to be the easiest day so far, but we'll see..."

          "I ate my breakfast while watching the sun rise over the mountains before getting going around 7:00 am. Right away the trail started going through some nice woods, and this was a nice easy way to start the day. The path was flat for nearly 3 miles! The woods also had plenty of open areas that provided pretty views of the mountains around us. Even when we had to start ascending, that portion wasn't that bad either.",
          "After reaching the upper portion of the trail, it now started going over exposed rocky hills, and zig-zagged through rocky columns. The rocky hillsides gave way to lush green hills and as we came over the summits we saw a pristine-looking mountain lake called Lac de Nino.",
          "As we descended down the trail from the tops of the hills we discovered that the lake was actually surrounded by a bog, and it was tricky walking across it and making sure we didn't step on a soft spot and fall in. There were already some large holes in the surface that gave us a peek into the watery depths below.",
          "We didn't swim in this lake though, it wasn't as pristine as it had looked from way up high. We took a short break on some boulders along the waters edge before setting off again. Thankfully the trail was flat for a few more miles as its stone-white path cut through the bright green grasses around it.",
          "We made it to the next establishment, another Bergerie, and ate some really, really, hard bread and tried to wash it down with more Orangina drinks. We set off across the open plains ahead of us and made our way to Refuge de Manganu. We arrived mid-afternoon and noticed that some cows kept walking through the camping area, nicking tents along the way with their horns, so we rigged up a make-shift fence out of some spare rope and rocks in order to try and keep them out of our area.",
          "There was a river flowing next the refuge, with some wide flat areas that were ideal for chilling in the water, and we took advantage of it.",
          "The refuge dinner was simple but filling. They're all mostly pasta and red sauce with bread, a meat, and a dessert. The setting sun blanketed the eating area making it a very toasty dinner."

          "A chilly morning started the day. It's day seven, and that means there's roughly seven more days to go. The trail has been hard but I am enjoying it. We had a slow start to the day once we got going. The way out of the refuge led towards a mountain ridge in the far distance, but first we had to navigate some more more bog-like ground.",
          "The trail went along shrubs and rocks as it wound its way up towards the ridge. We took a wrong turn at one point and had to double back, losing some time. The sun was rising behind this ridge, and thus the whole trail was in dark shadow. It took us about two hours to get to the top, where we took a well-deserved break on the stony ground, with a huge dropoff danging below us.",
          "The way down to the next ridge wasn't that bad. There were some drops were we had to scoot down on our butts, and rely on some chains for the other parts. There were two parts here: a lower and an upper, and we decided to take the lower route instead of scrambling over sharp-looking rocks on the upper portion.",
          "We continued along the trail that ran along the mountainside. It was windy and very chilly in this area. About an hour and a half later the flat section of the trail was done and it was time to start the ascent to a snow-patch covered area with ice-cold waters, perfect for dipping your feet in. The waters were too dirty to fully get into, but they were just right for feet.",
          "With cold refreshed feet I continued on towards the descent into the next refuge for the night. The way down was a lot steeper than it looked from high above, and it was filled with switchbacks (very steep switchbacks), and waterfalls, making the rocks extra slippery. But I made it down faster than I thought I would.",
          "I could tell that it was going to be a windy night for those in tents. I still haven't figured out how to properly pitch the tent, and that's also probably due to having to use rocks at every campsite because of the hard-packed ground. I hope they hold.",
          "This refuge has Sundaes, and eggs! I ordered a plate of fries on top of fried eggs, a coke, and a sundae for lunch. Super healthy, right? I didn't care, it was amazing and it hit the spot.",
          "Dinner was pre-assigned seating, which meant our group wouldn't be sitting together. Everyone is amazed that I came all the way from Chicago just to do this trek. I still haven't met any other Americans though.",
          "After dinner our gang played some more card games. Supposedly the refuge tomorrow has amazing lasagna, so I'm definitely looking forward to that!"

The temperature got as low as 53˚F, and the wind chill was probably 15+ degrees colder. Good news though: the sleep system worked well, and the tent also held up.",
          "During our breakfast of jam on toast and chocolate milk (oh so healthy) I was able to see some cloud inversion. Always a treat.",
          "The descent was initially very steep and we had to use our trekking poles as braces while hoping down from ledge to ledge, and down the various switchbacks. But eventually it became a more gradual and pleasant descent. We passed by many waterfalls as we went, and lots of cows were in the area keeping us company.",
          "Just before the halfway point we took a break at a Bergerie that sold quiche! But, to be honest, their cheese was awful. I couldn't stomach it and had to give it away. Their bread was decent though.",
          "The trail just before and after the Bergerie was amazing because it was flat, and went through forests filled with tall trees spaced far apart. A large river ran beside us over smooth boulders as we worked our way down. At the bottom of the trail there was a bridge over the river and below this bridge was another makeshift swimming area. We did some swimming in the waterfall/river, and it was much colder than the other swimming hole. Some of us even jumped off of the bridge into the river below.",
          "It would take about another hour to get up to the refuge through some gradual and then steep hiking, mostly over a wide trail just after the swimming hole and then over more narrower and rockier paths that slowly gained up the green hills around us. The camping at the refuge was in a grassy field, so it's easier to get a better tent pitch, but it's still not perfect.",
          "Finally, the first cold shower of the trip! I was wondering when this would happen. The number of hot showers on this trek was too good to be true! We played some more card games to pass the time before dinner, with some naps mixed in. Dinner was delayed for nearly an hour after we were seated, and the lasagna was just ok, in my opinion. Luckily we got seconds though. And dessert was chocolate mouse!",

Some are doing a double tomorrow, while others are taking a rest day in the town of Vizzavona. I had a hotel room booked there though, and I was eager to make use of their laundry services.",

          "It was still dark out when I awoke. Last night the clouds had started to creep in towards the camping area, and as we slept they left condensation on everything. Good thing I'm going to a hotel today. The way up and out of the refuge was rough as we headed for the top of the nearby mountain. It was very steep, with a fog slowly rolling in and obscuring the trail but it was worth it for the views at the top.",
          "The clouds were in abundance, and from this high vantage point I watched as they rolled over the ridge I had just come from, and the sun shone behind them, creating the best cloud inversion I had ever seen. I lingered for a good amount of time, staring, and watching.",
          "The rest of the way up the trail to todays high point wasn't too bad, but the descent on the other side was another story. The descent was really steep, and it felt like my ankles were being twisted this way and that. I had to traverse extremely smooth rock for a while, before then jumping from large boulder to large boulder when the trail reached a point where it turned downwards. It went on like this for quite a while, but luckily the descent eventually flattened out and the rest of the way was through forests.",
          "This was the easiest walk so far. After the descent was done the forested part was so easy, and everntually the trail merged with a forest preserve, which had nice wide and luxurious gravel trails. It was so easy in fact that I arrived at 10:45 am, and I had to wait three hours before the room would be ready. I went to a local bar in town (which was really just a grouping of 5 or so buildings and a train station) for drinks and snacks. Everything is very expensive in this tiny town, even more expensive than when at a mountain refuge.",
          "Finally, time to do some real laundry. I laid out my gear in the hotel room so that it could air out. I took a nice long shower, and then napped. It rained while I was falling asleep, loved it! Dinner was soon, which was good because I was starving. The dinner itself was alright, nothing too fancy, but I was honestlyexpecting more from this hotel. And they have breakfast at 7:00 am so it'll be a late start to the trail for me, but that's ok because it's only 5 hours tomorrow."

As soon as the rain stopped I was out the door and back on trail. The trails in the south are so much easier. It was a leisurely walk along wide, well maintained paths. All of the rivers and waterfalls were overflowing though thanks to the heavy rains yesterday afternoon and this morning, which made some crossings tricky.",
          "I was up and over the Col just above the town of Vizzavona and on my way to the first refuge after only one and a half hours! It was really windy up there though, and I nearly lost my hat so I didn't stay long. On the trail up from Vizzavona I ran into orange and black lizards know as Fire Lizards. They were decently sized, maybe as big as a soccerball.",
          "I chugged right along though until I reached Capenelle, my original destination for the day. It was a ski lift area, and the camping was directly underneath the lifts, not the most ideal. It was also to early to stay here: I think I would have been bored. But this place was known for having good pizza, so I took a break and had a long lunch. The pizza itself was huge! I had to fold the pieces in half in order to eat them, and it was really delicious!",
          "I took my leave of the refuge and started on the way to the next one. The trails were so flat and easy to walk, even with the occasional ascents and descents. I passed many abandoned refuges, who knows how long they've been this way. The route meandered through fields, zig-zagged up and down pine-wood filled mountainsides, and switchbacked down towards deep, dark, forests. I had nice sweeping views of the valley from many places on trail today. Part of the trail required walking on a road for a bit, but not for to long. Eventually I realized that I was alone on trail, and hadn't seen another person in a while.",
          "It rained off and on throughout the day, but I didn't need a rain coat because I was under trees for most of it. It was a very dreary day overall. I was doing good on energy, and was powering through todays portion: it was definitely going to be a double. After a while I started to wonder how far it was to the next place to stay, it seemed like I had been walking through these trees for ages and ages, not knowing if I was even on the correct trail anymore.",
          "For nearly an hour I wandered on, until finally coming across an official place to stay called Bocca di Verdi. It was reachable by road, and I debated going on simply because I wanted to be somewhere more rustic. I asked the guardian how much further to the next refuge, and he said about 2 hours. It was already 4:00 pm by this point and I had just done 17 miles of straight hiking today. Needless to say, I stayed at this place.",
          "Luckily I had also arrived just in time to order dinner. This place has log cabins, and a fireplace in the main building! I could have rented a cabin for myself, but the ground was flat here with tree coverage so I decided to camp it. After getting camp set up I went to the main building and read infront of the fireplace.",

I packed up early in order to try and make today a leisurely day given it would be another long one at nearly 8 hours. I stuffed the wet things into my bag and rushed through breakfast. The day started off with a steep rise through woods but leveled out for a bit and turned into bright green fields with a lovely river trickling through it before switchbacking to a Col.",
          "It was very windy as the clouds rolled in, and I had to throw on my windbreaker, first time this trip! I made it to the top of the Col and was presented with amazing views of the Mediterranean Sea. The winds up here nearly knocked me over, and for some reason it was freezing cold as well.",
          "There's a refuge up here called Refuge Prati, and as I passed by it just looked very \"sad\", I'm glad I didn't stay here, and I found out later that it was terrible. Apparently it was so windy that lots of people had to go into the refuge eating area to sleep because their tents were no match.",

I could see for miles in every direction, but the clouds kept coming and before to long the whole area was covered in fog. There were a lot of ridges to walk along. The trail also had a lot of narrow areas that had steep drops off to the right of me.",
          "The elevation profile for the day ended up being up and down, up and down, all while clouds made it hard to see anything more than 30 feet ahead. I had to climb over a field of steep boulders that seemed like they would give way at any moment, and doing this in the thick fog made it even more scary.",

It went along the ridge of a mountain for a while, and then through some trees, before starting to go in circles, or so it felt. At one point it felt like the trail was doubling back on itself around the top of a mountain. Col after Col, and still no descent towards the refuge.",
          "Finally a descent! And finally a view of the refuge. It's much higher up than I thought it would be, which probably means an exposed camping area and rough winds. On the way into the refuge area I had to walk past some angry looking horses.",
          "After finding a spot to pitch my tent I pre-paid for dinner, and bought some snacks from their general store because they didn't a have an a-la-carte kitchen, so I just picked up a bunch of small random foods and retreated to a nearby picnic table to scarf them down.",
          "While I hung out in my tent waiting for dinner the tent collapsed on me from the strong winds. I reinforced all stakes with more rocks, and even tied out four additional guy-lines. It held together for now. This tent, while very being lightweight and roomy, was not the best at shedding winds without the ability to properly stake it down. Around this time it also started to drizzle.",
          "This place, when I was there, didn't have a covered eating area, and the space to eat inside - which was actually the kitchen for hikers to cook their meals - was cramped and not many people could fit in there, so I had to eat dinner outside in the rain. While eating I made the decision to see if they had a tent available for purchase. Luckily, they did, and good timing to: my tent couldn't handle the increasingly strong wind, even with all of the extra stakes. I had to undo one of the extra stake-out points to be able to roll the door out of the way in order to pack things up, and as soon as I did the tent collapsed.",
          "I chilled inside the bomb-proof tent while the rain raged outside. After getting all of my gear situated I read and then fell asleep. This wasn't the best refuge on the trip, but I made the most of it.",
          "This trek has been great, with amazing views and varied terrain, and has been a great experience overall."

          "The wind howled all night, and the rain didn't let up. I couldn't stretch out fully in the tent, so I had to lay at an angle and/or curl up for most of the night. These tents are apparently daylight-proof though; I opened the flap to a nice sun-filled morning, nothing like last night.",
          "The trail started off by going up some mountain ridges with minor scrambling here and there. These ridges and their highs and lows looked deceptively small from far away, and seemed like they would be easy to do, but not so once I got to them. I got lost a couple of times, simply becaues the markers were difficult to find in certain areas.",
          "Once the ridge portion was done it was time to go down a muddy series of switchbacks towards the woods below. I was in good spirits as I raced down. After that the trail started to level out, and go through a small strand of trees. These trees gave way to gently rolling green hills dotted with large boulders, and I could see far into the distance: this would be the trail for a good long while today, which was nice. I was making great time as well. They weren't kidding when they said the southern portion was easier.",
          "Here and there large rivers and streams cut across the path, with some watery crossings along the way. These were some of the greenest areas of the trail that I had seen so far on this trip. After the river portion was done it was time to head through local farmers fields and past some other non-refuge places that people could stay at. I could have stopped for breakfast, but it didn't look like they were open for non-guest visitors just yet, so I kept going.",
          "The trail went up and around a series of twists and turns through lush vegetation and I came to an abandoned house with plant-life of all colors around it. And not a trail marker in sight. It took me and one other stranger a few random attempts of searching in multiple directions before we found the markers. Shortly after resuming the trail I came upon a refuge that I had orinally planned on staying at, and I'm glad I didn't. It was so bare and plain looking. I did stop though to rest and snack on the food I bought the previous night.",
          "The trail turned into a dirt and gravel road for a while. Eventually it branched off from the road and went through some very green land with a small river running through it. After a short while I came upon another place to eat at, and I decided to try and get some lunch here. Unfortunately I struck out: the kitchen wasn't open yet and wouldn't be for another hour or so. Disheartened I picked up my backpack and got back on trail.",
          "For the remainder of the afternoon the trail would go up at a steady rate, mostly along a road again before branching off and going back into nature. The landscape was very hilly and dotted with small boulders. It was a lovely sight. I was making amazing time doing two stages again.",
          "I didn't think the southern portion had any elevation points as high as the north, but here was one of them. It was nearly 6,500 feet above sea-level, and was up in the clouds. The ascent up to the top wasn't too bad though, and I couldn't see the refuge from way up here, but I'm sure it was down there somewhere. The descent was one of the worst, especially after doing a double-stage day. My knees were killing me. I made it to the refuge 1 hour earlier than the official time the signs along the way said it would take, not bad.",
          "Dinner here was delicious, and my stuff stayed dry overnight even though some clouds had decided to move in during dinner. There wasn't much to do up here, or many communal places to sit, and the temps were dropping fast, so I spent most of the night reading in my tent."

          "Last night was a terrifying one. Horses decided to wander into the camping area after everyone had gone to sleep, and literally walked right past my head. It's a good thing it was a full moon and that they could see the tents, or else I worry what might have happened. But then dogs started barking at them, spooking the horses and causing them to start galloping through the tents in order to get away. I laid awake in fright for a while.",
          "Today was the last day on trail, although I didn't quite know it yet. After doing multiple days of double-stages I wasn't sure if I had it in me to do nearly 20 miles today and finish, so my goal for the day was to make it to the last refuge on trail and spend the night there. With that in mind I packed up my stuff, and hit the trail.",
          "The trail started off by heading straight down into a valley from the refuge for a while and then crossing over to the other side of the valley, and then back up for a bit before leveling out for a good long while. Here and there were waterfalls and some tiny rivers that required crossing, but overall the early morning portion was mostly even ground with very little ups and downs.",
          "First it was through a forest, and then up towards a more desert-looking terrain with the trail being exposed to the sun for nearly the entire time. And, sure enough, I got lost again. I must have not been paying attention to the trail markers and probably missed a crucial one, but I ended up following a different trail that took me in the completely wrong direction. I bushwhacked, scrambed, and climbed my way back to the main trail.",
          "Once back on the trail I followed it closely and kept a vigilant eye out for markers. It now started to go up and up towards a forested area and a large public park that had a large amount of hotels and places to stay just down the road from it. I chose not to stop and take a break and to keep pushing through. The trail from this point was a very wide, and flat, dirt path.",
          "The flat portion ended eventually, and now there was a steep ascent up towards a mountain top. It took maybe an hour to get up there. From there it was another series of ups and downs before arriving at the last refuge on trail. I debated spending the night here, and after scoping it out and seeing that they too had cows and horses wandering through the campsite I decided that I had had enough of that and pushed on. I was going to finish today.",
          "It was such a long day, with so many ups and downs in elevation. My feet were killing me. About three hours after leaving the last refuge behind, and after many tiring ascents/descents, I came to a pass in the rocks that signaled the beginning of the end of the trail for me. It was like a gate you had to pass through.",
          "From here it would take about 30 minutes of racing downhill as fast as I could go before I reached the end of the trail, and emerged from the woods onto a paved road that led into the town of Conca, and the official end of the trek. I collapsed as I reached the bar that signaled the end, and I ran into my first American there! We shared a celebratory beer and then headed off into town to find the local campground (the cheapest of the options). From there, in the morning, I took a shuttle into Porto Vecchio where I had a hotel room waiting for me.",
          "This trek was the hardest I had ever done, and the most amazing. I met a lot of great people, and while there were struggles (both physically and mentally) along the way, overall this thru-hike was a great experience.",
          "I have finally completed the list of treks I first created back in 2018. What an amazing feeling!"

      "Filled with misty glens, deep lochs, and endless rain while hiking from Milngavie to Fort William, the West Highland Way is a long-distance trail in the highlands of Scotland spanning 97 miles. The trail travels down many ancient roads and old coaching routes, journeying from the lowlands to the highlands, while camping overnight in fields, along a lakeside beach, and under a bridge.",
      "I was not prepared for the amount of rain nearly every day of this trek that took 6 days to complete, and by the end of it I was chilled to the bone. But I witnessed some amazing mountains once I got into the Highlands at altitudes around 1,805 feet, with a total elevation gain of 14,342 ft and loss of 14,431 ft."

          "A good thru-hike should start like any other with a full backpack, wearing an unspoiled set of clothes, and a nervous walk to the starting point. And this thru-hike had all of those. I left my hotel at 7am on an empty stomach, unsure of what to expect from this adventure.",
          "First things first, I had to get breakfast before I caught a train from Glasgow to the starting point: Drymen. Luckily there was a familiar place to get some food: McDonalds. I ordered a basic breakfast menu item, and snarfed it down as I quickly walked to the station. You don't want to be late on your first day!",
          "The station was easy enough to find, however the exact gate was a bit harder to sus out. Good thing I was in a country that used my native tongue (or at least as close to it as Scottish is to American English). The platform wasn't on the main level, but a sub-level seeing as it was a more local train and not one bound for, example, London. Good thing I wasn't the only one heading that way.",
          "I didn't have to wait long for the train to arrive. Right on schedule. I felt uneasy stowing my backpack in one of the luggage shelves, so I kept it on my lap. There were some people on the train that I had seen yesterday as I toured the city, and others that I had spotted in the station this morning. One of those people sat across from me. I couldn't think of a non-awkward way of striking up a conversation, and considering I was pretty confident about what they would say seeing as they had a very large backpack with them, I said \"I hope this is the right train to Drymen for the West Highland Way.\" And that's all it took: we became instant trail-friends on the train, and hiked that first day together. By the second day though, I was on my own for the rest of the hike.",
          "A short train ride later and we were in Drymen. Our first priority was finding food for breakfast since I only had a small sandwhich from McDonalds, and they had nothing. We stood out as we went in the opposite direction of the trail starting point and went to a local grocery store. With food in hand we returned to the start point.",
          "You can judge how much a place cares about a trail by it's starting point. Is it ceremonious, or is it just a sign on a dirt trail? The West Highland Way (WHW) had a proper marker for the start of the trail in the form of a small obelisk, and an archway with the name of the trail in big bold letters on a metal banner across it. We posed for selfies before strapping in, grabbing our poles, and heading through the arch and onto the trail.",
          "For the first hour or so we walked through the outskirts of the town by going through a lands set aside as a city park or walking path area. By 10 am we were well out of the city and into open farm fields and pastures.",
          "Lots of short stone walls and wooden fences surrounded us as we walked along a gravel path. The trail was bisected by a road for a short while, and walking along a road is never a fun time. Luckily it didn't take long and we were back onto grassy terrain in no time. We passed through a metal gate, and were in the lowlands. There were green hills as far as the eye could see.",
          "Here and there trail markers dotted the path, emblazened with the WHW symbol. Clouds threatened to drop rain on us all day, but thankfully they never did. We marched through green fields, across rivers, and through thickets of trees.",
          "Around noon we came to our first resting spot of the day, a trail-side cafe called \"Turnip the Beet\". Clever. I ordered one of the most delicious trail sandwiches I had had in a long time. I gobbled the whole thing down in no time at all. Thirty minutes later and we were back on the trail, just before a light misting of rain began. We donned our rain coats and kept going.",
          "More green pastures and fields as the afternoon got on. The misty rain went away shortly after we continued walking, and sunny skies were with us for the rest of the day. Cows and sheep and ducks kept us company on both sides of the trail behind small wooden fences. We even passed a \"Trolls Bridge\" at one point. It was fenced off, but who knows if it was real or not.",
          "The dirt trail gradually turned into walking on a road once more, albiet a much more local and farm-type road (no lane markers, only wide enough for one car), so there wasn't much traffic. This road walking would continue until we made it to the first place for the night: a field on a farm in the town of Drymen, Scotland.",
          "By 3pm we had arrived. I set up my tent and got my home-on-the-go situated. This place had hot showers, a welcomed relief at the end of a long day of walking. I had a CLIF protein bar for a snack, and then sat there for a bit in front of my tent. Dinner time roled around, and it was time to fire up the trekking stove. I can't recall what the meal was, but it was a pre-made backpacking meal.",
          "After eating the person who I had walked with today asked if I wanted to go into the nearby town and grab a drink. Sure, why not. What else have I got to do here in a field on a farm? It took about 20 minutes to get to there, but there wasn't much...there. A small hotel with a restaurant and a bar/cafe that looked just a little too fancy for us. We opted for a pint at the hotel bar. It wasn't very glamorous, but at least it was something to do.",
          "We headed back to the farm after only one drink each, and settled in for the night. Tomorrow I would be heading to a campsite on the beaches of Loc Lomond, and if the sunny weather held it would promise to be an awesome experience."

          "No rain overnight, so that's a good sign for the day. My earplugs kept falling out as I slept, making true deep sleep ellusive for the most part. I dressed in my tent, packed up most of the gear, and exited to find a bright and cloudy sky awaiting me.",
          "Oatmeal with dehydrated banana slices is usually my go-to meal for backpacking trips that I need to bring my own food, and this hike was no different. I set about the task of boiling water on my tiny stove that was balanced on a piece of rock so as to keep the flames away from the, albiet wet, grass. My companion from yesterday emerged from their tent and started cooking breakfast as well. They mentioned that they would be taking it slow today, and that yesterday was rough on them, so I wished them a good hike and packed up my cooking gear after finishing breakfast, and set out on the route.",
          "We visited the town of Drymen last night, and today's route followed that same way. Once past the town the route detoured from the road and onto a more familiar dirt path that went between two farms. Green grass and yellow flowers filled the space around me as the trail gradually merged with a local forest preserve.",
          "Luxurious wide gravel paths took me through pine woods, and sections of wood that were bleached and/or regrowing from a previous disaster. Not more than an hour later and the trail left the forest preserve behind, and once more became a thin rock-strewn dirt path. The first views of the Loc were also attainable from here, but the path did not go directly to them and instead it curved to the right and towards hills and wide open lands.",
          "Multiple stone walls separated the terrain into varoius misshapen grid chunks. Gray clouds still hung overhead, threatening to start raining at any moment but thankfully they never did. The mid-morning destination was becoming clearer though as the trail was decidely heading in one direction: towards a massive hill/mountain.",
          "After a short bridge crossing over a meandering stream, the dirt path turned into stone steps, which meant it was time to climb. Luckily the steps didn't last for long before a dirt trail appeared and started to circle around and zig-zag up the side of this monsterous hill. All around me were fields and rolling hills patched up by strands of trees here and there.",
          "Finally, after a turn in the trail, the Loc was in full view. Another 20 minutes of walking and scrambling up some loose dirt/hillside terrain and I was at the top. What a sight to behold! The gray clouds even gave way to white pillowy clouds as I reached the top. This Loc was absolutely massive, and no wonder it would take the rest of the day today, and most of the day tomorrow, before finally getting around it. It must have been a weekend, or holiday, because the trail was filled with a bunch of weekend hikers out for a stroll.",
          "I knew I still had a ways to go today, so I spent just enough time up at the top to get some photos, have a snack, and relax before beginning the descent straight down to the local town below.",
          "Going down wasn't that bad, it was the amount of people on the trail that made it a not-fully-enjoyable time. But 30 minutes later and I was walking through bright green confifer woods. It was nearly noon and time for lunch. I had only brought enough meals for dinner and breakfast because I had read that there were plenty of stops along the way to get lunch and/or snacks. I found a restaurant on the edge of the water, and sat outside as I ate a burger and frees and sipped on a nice cold beer.",
          "Anxious to keep going I suited back up, refilled my water bottles, and set off into the woods once more. The trail started ascending once more to get back into the hills that surrounded that town. I passed by a few more WHW hikers as the trail meandered through the trees before settling into a route that ran parallel with the waters. The beaches that I passed were all very stony, and no sand was present. After about 1.5 hours of walking at a brisk pace through the hot and stuffy trees I was excited to finally come across the campground where I would be spending the night.",
          "My reserved spot was right on the beach, with a great view of the waters and surrounding hills/mountains. It was 4pm at this point, which meant a lot of time to just sit and chill. I strung up my dirty clothes to dry and air out, set up the tent (which was no easy feat in the winds that were blowing off of the lake), and sat in my backpacking chair. I read, took a nap, made some dinner, strolled along the waters edge, and didn't do much of anything else before it was time to go to bed.",
          "Today was a good day on trail: amazing views, variety of terrain, and good meals."

          "Thick gray clouds greeted me as I exited my tent in the morning. With a couple of bars of cell signal, I opened up the weather app to see if any rain was due in the near future. Sure enough, there it was: rain due in 30 minutes. I opted to skip cooking breakfast, and just chowed down on some protein bars as I packed up and hit the trail with my rain jacket on.",
          "Sure enough, about 30-40 minutes later the first rain drops started to fall. That's ok though, I thought, I've got a waterproof backpack and a good rain jacket to keep me dry. Just as a precuation I had also put on my polyester joggers (which were not waterproof) in order to provide some sort of rain protection as I hiked. The shoes were another story, sure they would get wet but they would also dry out quickly, if given the opportunity to do so.",
          "The trail hugged the coastline of the Loc for the most part, mixed with multiple detours into the surrounding green woods, but the waters were always somewhat visible. The rain was really starting to come down now, and it was only 8am. I passed an iconic red telephone booth in front of a bed and breakfast place. It smelled like they were serving but I wasn't hungry and wasn't defeated by the rain just yet.",
          "Clouds started to cling to the sides of the hills surrounding the waters. While most of the trail today was a dirt path, there were plenty of rocks strewn about it. Some small, some large, but all of them in within my way of walking, and all of them slippery from the rain. Good thing these Altra trail runners had good grip!",
          "I ran into a pair of mountain goats just chilling by the water under some trees, waiting out the rain, unbothered. I dared not get too close because you never know how a wild animal is going to react, and as soon as they caught sight of me I decided that it was time to move on.",
          "Small wooden bridges with railings crossed the more rugged areas of the trail, especially over freshly flowing rivers and waterfalls. The area surrounding the trail was full of bright green foliage, and colorful wildflowers. The trail meandered through open clearings towards mornings end, removing what little protection there was from the trees.",
          "Moss-covered stones of old ruins popped up here and there along the way, but there were no signs to indicate if they were of importance or not. Doesn't matter to me, all historical/old things are cool-looking. I'd guess these particular ones had been here for a while, given how much dirt and whatnot had accumulated within.",
          "About an hour later I came upon a massive waterfall that ran next to a hotel, and luckily it was open for business. A welcomed respite from the ran, with somewhere warm and dry where my things could dry off, hopefully. While they were open for business, the kitchen was not, and all they had to offer was water, juice, and coffee, plus some small pastries from the previous day. What a let-down. My feet were thankful though for the rest and fresh pair of socks though. I wasn't prepared for this much rain, and apparently (according to the locals at the hotel) that this is the norm in Scotland. I should have done better research. I rested for maybe an hour before continuing on.",
          "The trail led away from the hotel road and back along the lake, through a rocky and slippery mess. The designers of the trail must have thought people would enjoy sliding, crouching, and hopping from rock to rock. Not much fun in the rain though. I nearly slipped a handful of times, and had to go slow in order to avoid slipping in more dangerous areas. Luckily these section didn't last for too long before the trail was back to a flat path. However the flat trail was now a river.",
          "On and on I marched through the steady downpour of rain, wading through wet and muddy trail conditions. At one point the water flowing over the trail crested over the tops of my shoes, thoroughly soaking them through and through. About an hour later I came to a free place to spend the night: a hut with beds, fireplace, and lines to hang wet clothing. It was awfully cold in there, and I seriously thought about staying since I was so wet and just wanted to dry out. But as I sat there and contemplated going, the rain waters started to overflow the threshold at the door, and were slowly flooding the floor of the place. Needless to say, I opted to keep going, especially since there was no one else there and I would have been cold and alone all night.",
          "I pushed onwards towards Bienglas Farm, my original destination for the day. By about 4 pm, or two hours since I left the hut, I arrived. I'm so glad I didn't stay at that hut a while back. It's not really a farm, persay. Or at l east, not today it isn't, but might have been at one point. This place had hot showers, a restaurant serving hot meals, and a washing/drying machine for clothes!",
          "Picking a spot for my tent was tricky, since most of the grounds were flooded, or on a slope, but I found a spot under a broad tree with thick leaves. I asked the person who had also set their tent up there if it was ok that I joined them, and they said yes of course. I set up my tent, grabbed dry clothes, and set off for the showers.",
          "After a much need hot shower (of which I probably stayed in longer than I should have and used up way to much hot water), I went to the restaurant to get some hot food, and then off to the washing/drying machines for my laundry. With nothing left to do, and a non-existent desire to hang out in my tent in the cold wet air, I found a table in the restaruant and set up shop. A few other hikers joined me, as space as limited, and we conversed for most of the evening, and even split the laundry fee between us.",
          "Given all that had happened today with being soaked from the rain, I had decided to book a hotel for the next day. I usually don't give up this quickly, but something about the weather and the loneliness of the trail made me want some modern creature-comforts.",
          "I turned in around 9pm, looking forward to the dry big warm bed of a hotel the next day."

          "The morning brought a dryer outlook to the day than yesterdays did. While dark gray clouds still hung around in the sky, there were more patches of blue this morning than the day before. After a nice big traditional english breakfast I grabbed my backpack and set off at a later-than-usual start time of 8:30 am.",
          "Puddles littered the trail and made it quite the zig-zagging-game of avoiding them. Once or twice I skimmed the tops of puddles while trying to hop between them but I wasn't going to let that get me down. A slightly wet shoe toebox is better than a fully soaked shoe.",
          "Waterfalls and rivers were in full rage this morning after the deluge of rain. It made some crossings a little sketchy by having to balance on top of large rocks in the rivers waters, but overall it wasn't too bad. I soon left these raging watery challenges behind as the trail ascended into dryer pastures.",
          "Most of the morning was spent hiking through yellow grass fields and hills, with the occasional ruins of a building popping up on either side of the trail. Eager to put my good fortune with the weather to use, and being in happier spirits thanks to fully dry/clean clothing and a full belly, I started to walk at a brisk pace.",
          "By 11 am I was up above the fields I had been walking through for the past 2.5 hours, and had wide views of the mountains and hills around me. The clouds on the other hand were not being so cooperative and had thickened throughout the morning and were now threatening rain once more. Luckily no rain was falling yet, and instead of a fog was beginning to descend.",
          "After walking above the fields for a short amount of time the trail took a turn down and into some thinly-needled pine woods that slowly transitioned to some confifer trees. There were lovely little streams running through it, and the colors were really popping in here. It was a very pleasant walk through fog and trees and whatnot. But this lovely experience ended about an hour after entering the woods, because the exit from here was a massive section of deforestation. What a terrible thing to have on a national scenic trail.",
          "Over and under stone bridges, through more short stretches of woods, until I was once again walking through wide-open fields of green flanked by mountains on either side. Truly a beautiful site, even with the heavy clouds.",
          "By 12:30 pm I had reached the place I was originally planning to stay at, but becuase I was in such good spirits and the clouds were slowly going away, I decided to keep going and head for a popular spot, and the place I was going to go to the following day: the town called Bridge of Orchy. At 1:30 pm I came to a large town and grabbed some lunch at a restaurant. An hour later and I was off.",
          "Bright sunshine was now in abundance as I took the trail out of town and back into the mountains. Massive and impressive formations of mountains and hills dominated the views around me. The trail after the town was really wide, and practically level for the entire rest of the day. Needless to say, at my brisk pace I was making great time and covering a lot of distance.",
          "I walked into Bridge of Orchy around 4:30 pm, tired and exhausted after such a long day of walking. The spot for camping in this town was along the river that ran alongside it, next to the bridge the town is named after. The only buildings in this town were a church and an inn that you could stay at, but I opted for camping. It took a little while to find a level spot to set up, but eventually I found something. There were also a good amount of other people camping here as well. And there was a proper bathroom since a lot of people were also parking their RV's here. I snapped some photos of the bridge, and the surrounding countryside, made some dinner, and let my feet recover while sitting at a park table in the small camping area with some other hikers.",

          "Today would be filled with a mixture of sun and rain, and mountains, while traveling through the true highlands of Scotland. I had a cabin reserved for the night in the town of Kinlochleven, and would desperately need it after another rain-soaked day.",
          "A rivers rushing waters, a kind of whitenoise, always help me sleep. Breakfast today would be two packets of granola and two packets of dried banana slices. I had a surplus of backpacking food at this point, and would be able to leave the rest of it behind at the cabin tonight since tomorrow would be my last day on trail. The clock struck 8am, and I was on my way.",
          "Forests lined the riverbank where I slept last night, and it was nice to be walking within them right out of the gate. Rains last night created fresh wet conditions on the trail though, which meant more tiptoeing on any rocks that stuck their tops above water. My shoes did stay dry for long sadly.",
          "Not 30 minutes later and forests were already behind me, and scraggly grasslands lay before me, with a large lake in the distance. Up and over hills, dry patches of trail few and far between. Discontinous forests in oddly arranged groups were in the distance all around me, perhaps a reforesting process? Up ahead there was a bed and breakfast, but the restaurant services were only for guests and the store for buying snacks wasn't open yet. I waited a little bit to see if someone would come and open up shop, but they never did. Given how far I would have to go today I decided to simply bust out a protein bar and keep going.",
          "The terrain today varied between forests, and grasslands, and the trail seemed to stretch on forever into the distant mountains. By this point, around 10am, the clouds started to drop their rain on me. It started as a fine mist, but slowly turned into a steady downpour of rain. I did not see many people on today's segment, maybe the rain kept them away.",
          "Besides the rain, the views on this part of the trail today were amazing! I love hiking in the mountains, and today I was surrounded by all sorts of them. I truly felt like I was alone in the world today, walking through this remote land, with the unrelenting rain beating down on me, and not another soul in sight.",
          "For nearly two hours I marched on through the rain, up and over small passes between mountains, trying to stay in good spirits. Eventually the trail left the remote world behind and joined up with a paved road that led to a hotel called The Kingshouse. It's one of the stops along the way, and I hoped they would have hot food, and sure enough, they did.",
          "I spent a good long hour there, eating hot food, and trying to let my stuff dry out as much as possible. I used one of the bathroom stales to change out of my wet clothing, and into some fresh dry things. There's nothing like a dry pair of socks and underwear to immediately brighten ones spirits. At 1pm I left The Kingshouse behind and continued on me way, through more mountains.",
          "The rain was done for the day, thank god, and the sunshine brought the most amazing views I had seen so far. A bright blue sky, and dark stone mountains, dominated my view, and the world around me. These pictures don't do it justice.",
          "After walking through these amazing mountains for another 90 minutes, it was time to start descending down into the town of Kinlochleven. It was a long way down, took nearly an hour but felt like forever what with all of the twist and turns in the trail. Eventually I reached the towns outer limits, and it wasn't a pleasant way to enter the town: the trail exits right next to a factory.",
          "There were also no waymarks as I got into town telling me which way the trail would go tomorrow, so I had to pop open Google Maps and figure out how to actually get into the town. After a wrong turn I made it to the town center. Finding the cabin took a bit more effort, and figuring out where to go in was also tricky, I even had to call the host in order to figure out where to go.",
          "I settled in and began laying out my cold wet gear in order for it to try out. The place had a TV, which was nice, and the bed was big and comfy. I made the last of my backpacking meals for dinner, and discarded the rest. I was looking forward to a good nights sleep."

          "Here it is, the last day on this rainy and lonely trail. Can't say that I'm sad that this trek is coming to an end. It wasn't my most favorite, even though it had its fair share of amazing sights and challenging experiences. Today I would be making for Fort William, and my hotel at the end of the West Highland Way.",
          "I didn't take many photos today, I was too focused on finishing and making it through the rain that hounded me all throughout the day. At least the day started with partly sunny skies. It took some searching, but I eventually found where the trail continued, and made my way up and out of the town. While trail started with a steep ascent to get back up into the hills and mountains, it was mostly flat the rest of the way, until the descent into Fort William.",
          "Fjords were visible in the distance, signaling the incursion of the Atlantic ocean. For a good while the trail went down the middle of a long and narrow valley, flanked by scraggly grass-covered mountains. The trail hung to the right-most side of the valley, and weaved its way through the hills.",
          "After exiting the valley area I went up and down over several small hills, and in and out of forests. I didn't take many breaks on the trail today, I was, again, too focused on finishing. The trail merged with a forest preserve trail which meant it would be a nice wide manicured path. The rain had also started to fall by this point. But my rain jacket had been on all day. In fact, I can't remember I time in the past three days when I wasn't wearing it.",
          "Up ahead I could see the tallest mountain in the UK: Ben Nevis. I had hoped to summit it the following day, but the weather would not cooperate. After about an hour of descending I was on mostly flat ground again, and close to the end. It was a full downpour of rain by now, and I don't think I had any dry clothing left on me, except for the outfit I would be wearing while I was in Fort William and while traveling back to my hotel in Glasgow.",
          "Here the trail left nature behind and met up with a sidewalk along a busy section of road. For an hour I walked through the heavy rain, as cars sped by me. At least this part of the trail was waymarked. I entered the outskirts of the town, and had to pull up Google Maps in order to figure out where my hotel and the end of the trail was.",
          "While the beginning of the trail had a ceremonious marker and beginning, the end did not. It was simply a bench with a statue of some old man on it, and a sign that said \"The end of the West Highland Way\". There streets around me were empty, due to the rain, and there were no other hikers finishing at the same time as me, so this was a rather sad and lonely ending to a not-so-fun trek. Defeated, I headed for my hotel and a warm bed.",
          "I spent the next day and a half warming up as best I could: the hotel heater wasn't working in the building so they gave me a small portable space-heater. Needless to say I didn't do much exploring on the day that I arrived. The next morning I went out to breakfast (the hotel didn't offer much), and shopped around for a souvenior. I had to find a pin of the hike though, as I had done on all previous hikes, in order to add to the collection on my backpack. I finally found one at the last place I visited, just before having to leave to catch the evening train back to Glasgow.",
          "The West Highland Way had been on my bucket list of hikes for a long time, and I gotta say that I was mostly dissapointed by it. It wasn't what I had thought it would be, and it would make me doubt if I would ever want go on another thru-hike ever again."

      "A tapestry of landscapes surrounded spires of granite, sprawling glaciers, pristine lakes, and windswept plains providing an idyllic background for thru-hiking 8 days and 73 miles in Chile. Here at the bottom of the world in Patagonia, with equal parts rustic and modern, the trail known as the 'O' Circuit circumnavigates the prominent Torres del Paine granite towers that the park is known for. But the real highlight of the circuit took place after summitting the ridge at John Gardner Pass at 3,874 feet and seeing the massive Grays Glacier layed out below, filling the horizon from end to end."

          "Finally, I have come back to South America, and come back to Patagonia. I'm actually here, and actually doing the \"O\" Circuit. But not yet, first I need to take a bus from Puerto Natales (my base of operations for the next 11 days) to the Torres del Paine National Park. This was going to be my first time thru- hiking a trail while camping every night, and carrying all of my own food. My backpack must have weighed close to 30 pounds at the start. I had done some research and bought a lot of ultralight gear for this trip, including the backpack, as well as my tent. Fingers crossed!",
          "The bus dropped me and over a dozen other hikers off at the welcome center to the park, where we watched a mandatory video on what not to do in the park, paid an entrance fee for the hiking permit, and set off onto the trail.",
          "And I took a wrong turn. Instead of going straight at a fork, I went right and ended up heading towards a maintenance shed at the entrance. Luckily I wasn't the only one who got turned around: a pair of canadians were ahead of me and I had been following them hoping they would guide me onto the main trail. As we all turned around one of them (Charles) said \"never follow Canadians\". From that point forward we walked together for the rest of the day, getting to know eachother along the way. Adèle (studying high-level math) and Charles (working in corporation-land) were from Quebec and had done lots of hikes to the Adirondack mountains in upstate New York. Little did I know but we, and a handful of others, would end up walking the entire circuit together.",
          "This landscape is amazing: rivers snaking through yellow-green fields of grass with snowcapped mountains encircling us, with patches of forest along the way. Not a hard trail either, in terms of ascent/descent and difficulty walking. We were making great time, and it would only take us about 3 hours to get to our first campground on this circuit: Seron.",
          "After walking through the yellow-green fields for about 30 minutes, we entered a sparsley wooded forest. We chatted the whole way through, asking all sorts of questions about where we're each from, what we do for a living, culture norms, etc. The forest did not last long and we were back under the sun once more.",
          "It was so quiet down here, at the bottom of the world. It's a remote area to begin with, along with a really low population density, it felt like we were in another world.",
          "We snaked our way through the grassy fields, taking in the sights around us. A couple of river crossings blocked our path, some of the rivers overflowing from the downpour of rain that hit the area last night. Luckily the trail was not waterlogged, and our socks n' shoes stayed dry.",
          "Maybe three quarters of the way in we stopped for a snack on some tree logs next to one of the river crossings. We didn't stay long though thanks to all of the mosquitos that werwe buzzing around us. Didn't matter though, we were practically done with today's segment. 30 minutes later and a wooden sign on a tree informed us that we had reached Campamento Seron.",
          "The campground had a large tent for campers to cook in, and some heavy-duty tents on raised wooden platforms in a small field that was bordered in by large bushes. There were also hot water showers (yes!) and full-service bathrooms. But the main camping area was \"out front\" and it was a field full of tall yellowed grass. It was a picture-perfect setting. But as luck would have it, some rain started to fall as we started picking spots for our tents and setting up camp.",
          "For this trip I chose a pyramid-style tent that was made out of a lightweight and waterproof proof material called Dyneema. It was supposed to be great at deflecting winds, and it most definitely was. We had some wild winds overnight, possibly approaching hurricane-force at one point. But I felt safe and secure in my tent, and I slept pretty dang well, even if the ultralight sleeping pad I had bought for this trip made the sound of a chip bag crinkling whenever I moved."

The others were already awake and/or slowly rising as well, which meant it was time to make some oatmeal for breakfast, and start packing up.",
          "It felt like we walked through those golden-bright fields of grain forever this morning. It sure was a sight to behold. But all good things must come to an end, and we started to hike up and up until we were overlooking a large lake below. The wind had also picked up at the top of the hill we had just climbed and was blowing everyones hair all over the place. Ugh, but who could complain; these views!",
          "On the other side of the hill the wind was less intense as we walked through woods made of short round pine trees, and some others that had been through a forest fire in years passed. A large tourquise river flowed nearby, but luckily we didn't have to worry about crossing it, or walking alongside it. There was a checkpoint in the woods that the trail went by where we had to get our permits checked, in order to ensure we were authorized to be there. No issues, and on we went.",
          "Pine trees gave way to yellow grains which gave way to dark green flora. We could also see snow-capped mountains in the distance, as we steadily walked in their direction. We came upon some marshy lands, and thankfully there was a well- maintained boardwalk going through them. If that wasn't there, this would have been a very different kind of day.",
          "After about 30 minutes we left the marshes behind and we greeted with our first sights of Dickson, our refugio for the night. It sat on the shores of a large lake, encircled by trees and had a large field where we could pitch our tents if we wanted to, however; nature is a fast teacher. Given the experience we all had last night from the wind, we all choose spots near the treeline, or behind tall bushes, so that we would be protected from any future gale-force winds.",
          "The refugio had a full indoor kitchen within which to cook our meals, as well as hot showers and full bathrooms. The best feature about this place though, was the shoreline and rocky beach behind it. I walked up and down it, snapping photos of the monsterous mountains that lined the shores on the other side from us, and some of them were actually in Argentina, that's how close to the border we were!"

          "A successful night of sleeping once again, and even more so given the protection from the wind by the trees and bushes around us. The ground was a little muddy, but that's alright. I had brought a thin, cheap, groundsheet with me and after using it last night it was already a mess and had to be tossed, but it turns out I wouldn't need it for the rest of the trip.",
          "Most of the morning would be spent walking up and down hilly land through forests with the occasional lookout point here and there. There were a few river rossings aided by wooden bridges, nothing too crazy. I thought the trail was going towards the mountains in the distance, but instead it took a right turn after exiting the woods and we started to hike up a rocky trail.",
          "The real treat today would be the morraine and glaciar along the way, just before reaching Los Perros (our place for the night). It was a detour from the main route, so not many people chose to go there, which means we had it mostly to ourselves. It reminded me of the glacier that I hiked to when I first visited Santiago, Chile in 2016. We waded in as far as we dared in the ice-cold waters, and lay out on the rocks for a little while, soaking up some sun. Eventually we had to leave and check-in at the campground in order to secure some good sites.",
          "Los Perros campground was mostly in the woods, with all of the sites being in muddy areas. We chose the dryest, and safest (always check for window-makers in the trees above you), looking spots and set up our tents. More modern convenicnes at this place as well: hot showers, bathrooms, kitchen to cook in. But it was slightly more buggy than the last two places (probably all of the trees). There was a river nearby where we could fill up our water, after filtering it of course.",
          "I grabbed my book and headed out to a grassy area outside of the campground and laid out under the sun and read for a bit. Self-entertainment during the period of downtime between setting up camp and waiting to make dinner was a requirement. Some read, others took naps, and others chatted. So far not a bad three days of hiking!"

          "My tent's bottom was covered in mud, but thankfully the portion that laid on the ground only took up half of the total floorspace of the tent, so not much to worry about. Today's goal was reaching Grey's Glacier, and crossing over the highest point of the trail. This meant a lot of ascending today, nearly non-stop climbing as soon as we left Los Perros behind.",
          "I had gotten soft over the last few days of walking on nearly-level ground. This climb was rough, and I had to stop often in order to catch my breath. But we were getting really high up, and I love being high up in the mountains. The green vegetation of the forest gave way to rocky barren mountainsides, and snow patches were all around us.",
          "Oddly enough, even though I had to stop quite often to catch my breath, it only took about 90 minutes from when we left Los Perros to get to the top of the pass. Laid out before us was a white majesty of a glaciar. It was massive! This was my first time seeing one from up high, and up close. We spent over an hour up top, just gazing out over this majestic creation of nature.",
          "The climb down was harder. The glacier remained in view for the rest of the day as we zig-zagged down switchbacks, and skirted along narrow paths cut into the rock. After crossing a long suspension bridge it was time to start taking several dozen switchbacks down through the forest on the other side of the ridge we had just summitted. The thickness of the trees created a stuffy feeling that motivated me to practically run down the trail in order to get out of them as quickly as possible. Once down and back on flat ground, I power-walked towards Refugio Grey, thinking I had fallen behind the others who had headed down off of the ridge before me. Along the way I passed by some scat which only helped to quicken my pace, given that Pumas and other wild cats lived in the area.",
          "Grey had a nice field for setting up tents, and an even nicer refuge for hanging out at: they had adirondack-style lounging chairs out front, which is where I ate my dinner, while watching the sun go down upon the mountains."

Today would be a short day in terms of hiking, but would give us extra time to do a little side-hike over to a place that had some amazing views of the mountain that dominated the place we were staying at tonight.",

          "We passed through a cut in the rock and descended down a small valley as we came upon Paine Grande. There was a lovely lake nearby, and a small side-trek that we decided to check out after setting our tents up. I choose a flat grassy spot for mine, while others chose to pitch along the edges of the field near rocky outcropings or bushes. There were even fences set up at right angles throughout the field for tents, which should have given me a clue about how much wind this place receves. Sadly, I didn't pick up on it.",

The waters were nice and cold, and shallow as well, and we spent some time going far out into them. We were there for maybe a couple of hours before we decided to head back. By this time the winds had picked up, and our tents at the campsite were holding their own against it, but you could tell that it was going to be a windy night."

          "What a windy night it was. Nobody got any sleep, except maybe for those who had paid for a bunkbed inside of the refuge. Several tents had pieces bent, including my own: one of the trekking poles bent in a strong suddent burst that sounded like a gun going off in the distance. I had to tie some extra guywire string around the center pole in order to secure it against any future bursts, which worked and I was able to get another hour or two of sleep.",
          "Such a beautiful morning though, as we came out of our tents the sun was casting a bright pink light upon the clouds that hung out near the top of our nearby mountain peak.",
          "Today we would be hiking through ghost forests, and along a large lake that may or may not be connected to the ocean currents in the distance. Los Cuernos (the horns) were a pair of mountain peaks that dominated the area and were within constant sight. While the mileage might be higher than yesterday, the trail is so flat and easy to walk that we made great time. So great in fact that we were able to do another side-trek on our way to Refugio Frances.",
          "Valley Frances was the side trek, and it took us up behind Los Torres into a wide circular valley that was chocked full of green forests, and interesting rock formations on the perimeter. The trail to get there was easy to walk and navigate. It went along a quickly flowing river, up and down over sandy and muddy terrain, in and out of the trees. After about an hour of hiking we came to the valley center, and did a bunch of 360's, taking it all in.",
          "About two hours after leaving the valley, and retrieving our packs that we had left at the entrance to the trail, we arrived at Frances. It was a campsite perched upon a tree-covered steep sloping hill, which meant everyone got a platform to pitch their tent on. My tent barely fit (it's got a wide base), but I felt good about being within the trees: they would keep the winds away and we could all sleep peacefully. The place to shower and cook was at the bottom of a trail that went down towards the waters edge. I wasn't in the mood to go up and down this trail very often while staying here, so I only went down there to shower, and then later to make dinner. I'm sure there was lots to see down there, I just wasn't in the mood.",
          "I read for a while in my tent after dinner, but the forest gets darker faster and before long it was time to go to sleep. Tomorrow we would be going to Chileno, our last Refuge, and then the day after that the Towers themselves!"

          "Today would be an amazing day of walking along sandy and stony beaches (not something I had expected to run into down here), and through grassy fields. We would be making for Refuge Chileno, which is part of the \"W\" portion of the \"O\" Circuit, and the base of operations for anyone who wanted to hike to the Towers.",
          "I saw some water spouts as we hiked along the beaches. This whole trek has been nothing but amazing views! After about 90 minutes of walking it was time to leave the water behind and head back into familiar looking territory, seeing as we walked through this same area about a week ago when we set out from the welcome center.",
          "There were a lot of day hikers on the trail today, which threw us off for a moment because we had gotten used to wide open trails and low traffic over the past several days. Nonetheless, I was very nostalgic as this was the same route I had day-hiked 4 years ago, nearly to the day. It brought back so many memories, and things felt so familiar to me.",
          "For this refuge I had booked a bunk bed because I was finishing the trek a day earlier than I had previously planned. It was a welcomed treat after having camped for the past six days. I did not purchase the dinner though, and made my own backpacking meal (my last). I was not alone though as others had also not purchased the meal, but I wish I had (it looked so delicious).",
          "We went to bed early tonight because we were waking up at around 3 am in order to hike up to the towers in the dark in order to watch the sun rise over them."

          "The last day on trail, and the day of The Towers! I was so excited to hike up to them for the second time in 4 years. I slept really well last night, thank you bunk bed. Everyone was getting up at 3am, so there was no worries about waking anyone up unintentionally.",
          "Today was going to be a long day though: we would first hike up to the towers, hang out for a while while the sun rose, and then hike down, grab breakfast and our gear, and then head the rest of the way down back to the welcome center, and our bus ride out of here.",
          "We packed up our phone cameras, left our bags behind, turned on our headlamps, and headed out. When I had first day-hiked to the towers it was, well, during the day. Doing this in the darkness of the pre-dawn hours was a totally different experience. The trail was well marked though, which made it easy to find our way.",
          "Finding a good spot at the top wasn't easy, but eventually we found one with shelter from the wind, and enough space for us all to set up our phone cameras in order to record (in timelapse) the rising sun. While we waited, someone started singing \"The Final Countdown\" which was very fitting since we kept checking the time and staring intently at the rocks as they slowly appeared.",
          "It was a truly magical experience. We all took turns taking photos staring at the towers. But sadly it was time to leave, and head back to civilization, and reality. The hike down was fast, it was all downhill afterall! We didn't have to wait long the for the bus, and since we were all staying in the same town we met up for dinner that night (our group was quite large now) for pizza.",

          "Last night, sleep wasn't easy. I was staying at a hostel in Pokhara and the other guests in my room had a late night, and also snored very loudly. Groggy, and hungry, I gathered any loose things of mine, grabbed my backpack, and packed everything up outside where I wouldn't disturb anyone.",
          "The previous day I had taken a taxi from the airport to the hostel I stayed at, but it was too early in the morning today for a ride, so that meant walking to the bus station. The walk wasn't that bad, maybe 10 minutes? I felt like a fool for taking a taxi yesterday. The bus station itself was little more than a dirt parking lot behind some buildings. There was a food stand selling coffee and pastries, and boy was I starving. I bought a couple of pastries, and a banana.",
          "Other hikers were alredy there at the bus station, and more continued to arrive as I waited. There were people of all ages doing this hike, or various others in the area. The bus driver announced which bus was for Besishar, and I walked over to it and waited. While I waited some folks joined me, and we introduced ourselves: Katie from New Zealand, Nathan from England, and Véronique from Canada. We hit it off right away, and this would be our group, more or less, for the entire circuit.",
          "The bus ride to Besishar (the starting point of the circuit/thru-hike) was a long and bumpy one. It picked up several locals as well on the way there, some even brought furniture on the bus with them. Space got tight for a little while. It was late morning by the time we arrived. Nathan, at the behest of the rest of us, had to purchase a down jacket and some other gear that he had not originally brought with him. Luckily theres were \"cheap\" here in Nepal.",
          "Finally we set off on the trail and began the circuit. The trail went up from the city and into the jungles, and crossed a very long and narrow suspension bridge over a gorge with a fast-flowing river below. As we got further along and into the jungle bright green fields of crops started to pop up all around us. The homes where the farmers lived were all vibrantly colored in reds, pinks, greens, and yellows, and most of them had bright blue roofs.",
          "As we hiked we got lost in conversation, and ended up getting lost about halfway in. Time to bust out the Maps app. We thought we found the trail on the app, but after a short while of walking we realized it wasn't the right way. A small family of farmers were working in their field and we went up to them to see if they could help us. The parents knew English very well, and were able to point out the way. They were also excited to show their kids our smartphones.",
          "Now that we were back on track we started walking at a slightly brisker pace. I was starting to get really hungry at this point, seeing as I had only had a couple of pastries and a banana for breakfast some 6 hours ago, but I kept going. We stopped for some water at a small waterfall, but the water filter pouch I had sprung a leak, and therefore I wasn't able to use the water filter system anymore. Thankfully Katie had a ton of extra chlorine tablets and I ended up using those for the rest of the trip.",
          "We walked for about another hour, crossing more suspension bridges (the last of which looked like it would fall apart at any moment), and finally made it to the outskirts of Bhulbule, the village we would be spending the night in. But as we entered the village, my body decided that it had had enough and I instantly felt super weak and tired. I busted out some protein bars that I had brought with me for this first day of hiking, and we took a break on some stone steps leading into the village.",
          "Rested, and fed, it was time to begin the task of finding a place to sleep. The Annapurna Circuit relies on a system of teahouses for housing the hikers who attempt the hike, and these teahouses are run by local families. We found one that had a nice eating area, showers, and clean-looking rooms, and we began the negotiating process. In the end the owner gave us a room for three, with a fourth mattress that they put on the floor, so that we could get a discounted rate for staying there, and since we agreed to have dinner at their place we were locked in.",
          "What a series of events today: making three new friends right out of the gate, a long and bumpy bus ride, getting lost in the jungle, and nearly collapsing from hunger. The place we were staying at had nice hot showers though, and great food! Here's to a less eventful day tomorrow."

          "We passed by some pretty tall waterfalls on our way out of the village, and it felt good to get misted on by the falling waters. We walked along the river created by the waterfall for a while, even as we got higher and higher up. More suspension bridges greeted us as we had to cross back-n-forth over the river during the course of today's trail.",
          "The trail was a mixture of gravel, dirt, grass, and mud today. Luckily it was mostly footpaths, and only a small section was shared with the occasional passing jeep.",
          "A few hours in and we stopped for lunch at a teahouse perched on the edge of a cliff. They had beds here, but it didn't look very inviting. The food though, can't go wrong with veggie mo-mo and orange soda. The place had a great view of the valley below though, and of all the tiered fields and homes hugging the side of the mountains. We stayed here for more than hour relaxing.",
          "As we left the lunch spot we entered the area of Gandaki, and were greeted by a large archway over the trail welcoming us. We were getting high enough now that we can look out over the valley, and trail we had covered so far, below us.",
          "A beautiful waterfall broke up the trail a little further in, and we had a fun time waiting for the hikers in front of us to find their way across the slippery stones. A few trekking poles and hats were lost to the fast flowing waters.",
          "On and on we marched over rock and dirt trails carved into the mountainside, each blind bend in the trail revealing amazing views as we made our way around. Before too long and we were at our place for the night: Jagat. A fun attraction for this place is a steam bath fed by natural hotsprings. It was a bit of a side hike to go down to it at the rivers edge, and the hike back up wasn't fun ( thankfully we weren't that high up in elevation yet or else it would have been a lot harder). Lots of the locals also used the waters to bath it seems.",
          "There was a suspension bridge that connected one side of the gorge to the other up near the village, and our group posed for a photo on the bridge. It was swaying so much with the slightest movement, we all hurried off of the bridge once the photo was taken. Why push our luck?"

Pisang looked so tiny now from up here.",

It's hard to tell how many of these buildings in this small villages are still lived in, and how many are just ruins. We also pass by a bunch of small temples dedicated to Buddha.",

Lots of jeeps coming through here today, which meant hurrying off of the road and covering our faces to avoid the dust storms they kick up. I wish I had my neck buff for this.",

It took a bit of searching, but we finally found a place to stay that \"felt right\" to everyone in our group, and booked rooms for two nights here since we would be doing a day-hike tomorrow up to a lake at 15,000 feet as part of a conditioning routine that would get us ready for the highest point of the trek in a few days.",

The way up was hard, and took nearly 5 hours to get up there. But once we got up there the views were jaw-dropping. It was the highest I had ever been in my life. It was soo cold up there that we weren't able to stay long before our fingers inside of our gloves started to freeze. The way down wasn't as bad, but half of our group got separated and we ended up getting lost on the way down. Luckily we found our way back to the road, and to our home for the night.",

          "We had to say goodbye to Nathan yesterday. He had to continue on in order to finish the trek by a certain date, and couldn't take the variant route to Tilicho Lake with us, which is where we would be spending the night before heading up to the worlds highest freshwater lake at 15,500 feet. The three of us left Manang, and crossed a suspension bridge out of town in the early morning hours.",
          "Most of the trail today would be going alongside mountain slopes that looked like they had either just had a landslide, or were about to. A couple of times a supply train of donkeys would cross our path and I got nervous that they would send the stony trail tumbling down. Luckily that never happened.",
          "This terrain though looked like something from an alien world.",
          "For nearly 5 hours we marched up and down these slopping hills, gaining altitude with each step. We took a mid-day break at small set of teahouses in a place called Shree Kharka, and decided to stay here on the way back from Tilicho Lake the following day, instead of pushing all the way for Thorong Phedi. The teahouses here are so colorful!",
          "Eventually, after a long day of hiking, we arrived at Tilicho Lake Basecamp, and found what appeared to be the last places to sleep. There was a catch though: this room for all of us to share was in a small hut behind the main building. This meant thin walls, windows with holes in them, and rough mattresses to sleep on. It was better than nothing.",
          "The dinner here was really good though. My body is finally getting used to eating nothing but cheap Dal Bhat, and the free refills! We went to bed early tonight after spending all evening hanging out in the dining hall reading and playing cards. Tomorrow we would be getting up early to do the hike up to the lake."

          "Stars filled the cloudless early morning sky as we awoke around 3am and started getting packed up for our hike up to Tilicho Lake at 15,500 feet. It was cold and hard to move so early in the morning, but we managed to make our way onto the trail with our headlamps lighting the way.",
          "Sunrise came about an hour and a half into our hike, slowly revealing the snowy-white world around us. The first half of the trail wasn't too bad, but the second half, as we got higher and higher, forced us to stop and take more breaks. Once we got to the more flat part of the trail our speed increased and we made it to the lake about 2-3 hours after starting.",
          "While the lake itself wasn't unique in any obvious way, other than being at such a high elevation, it was the snow-covered mountains around us that really set the mood. As we stood there staring out of the lake a rumbling sound in the distance caught our attention and up near one of the peaks we could see an avalanche starting to careen down towards the lake. It was on the far side, so we were in no immediate danger, but it was an amazing sight to see.",
          "We couldn't stay long at the lake for it was far too cold and our fingers were going numb inside of our gloves (I even had to layers of gloves on). As we were leaving another, much larger, avalanche occurred that filled the space above the lake with powdery snow, but we were too far below the ridgeline to see it fully sadly.",
          "The way down went much faster, as it always dows, and we were moving at a fast pace in order to warm back up. We debated stopping at Basecamp on our way back for breakfast but decided to keep moving and stay at Shree Kharka instead because there was one particular place that had a dining hall with an amazing view of the mountains and valley below us.",
          "The way back over the landslide-ridden trail went by much easier than it did yesterday, and again luckily there were no incidents. We chilled for the rest of the day at Shree Kharka, playing card games, listening to podcasts, and eating. We made our plans to go to Thorong Phedi tomorrow, and then onto Thorong La Pass (the highest point on the trek at 18,500 feet) and then to Muktinath."

          "Today we would be heading back towards Manang, and then taking a sharp left away from the valley that Manang resided in as we would be turning torwards Thorong La Pass, and the climax of our trek together.",
          "We left Shree Kharka and bid farewell to the sand-colored valley walls. Small scraggly bushes now dominated the landscape around us as we retraced our steps. At an outlook point overlooking Manang we stopped and posed for pictures, saying goodbye to the first half of this circuit, and then turned to the left and continued our hike upwards and onto another valley.",
          "Upon entering this new valley we could see the entire trail laid out before us, twisting and bending and winding its way over the terrain. On we marched, heads down, focused on closing the distance between us and our place for the night at Thoron Phedi. We stopped for lunch at a place that had teepees available for sleeping in, and enjoyed some food and sodas.",
          "It was still going to take us another 3-4 hours before we would be able to see the refuge for the night. Up and down the rocks we went, over rivers, through small thinly wooded forests, climbing ever higher. Today we would technically be losing more elevation than we would be gaining, but it was still a challenge to gain any altitude.",
          "At long last we arrived, nearly 7 hours after starting the days hike. These were some of the hardest mattresses I have ever slept on, but this place had __*the best*__ veggie burger that I have ever had. Tomorrow wouldn't be as early of a day as yesterday was, so we had a chance to catch up on some sleep before making the pass."

          "The big day had finally arrived: crossing over Thorong La Pass and entering the second half of the circuit. Today would be another day of less altitude gain when compared to how much we would lose. We ate our breakfast in a hurry as we were eager to begin.",
          "It was a slow march up from Thorong Phedi to the pass. The trail was crowded, and thanks to the extreme elevations we were at (we started at 15,000 feet) we had to stop and take many breaks. One foot in front of the other, that's all ya gotta do. But after 3.5 hours we made it to the pass!",
          "We were filled with joy at accomplishing such a tremendous effort. We dropped our heavy packs and reveled in what we had done. Our group of three crouched and posed for a photo at the sign marking the high point of the circuit. As we stood up we all became extremely light-headed and dizzy. It was no joke moving around at these altitudes. Even the slightest amount of steps caused us to become winded. Eventually though it was time to start our long descent down towards Muktinath.",
          "After three hours of racing down the mountain, and stopping for a refreshment break at a refuge on the way down, we made it to Muktinath. This was a fairly good-sized city with plenty of places to stay and stores to window-shop at. We chose a place called Bob Marleys and it was a pretty nice place. They had nice showers with rain showerheads, comfy beds, and one of the best restaurants on the trek. Seriously, I had some pasta Carbonara here (my first time having it) and it was amazing! They also had a nice lounge below the restaurant for hanging out."

          "Our destination today was Marpha, for some of us at least. Katie from New Zealand would be saying goodbye and taking a bus from the town just before Marpha and heading back to Pokhara in order to continue their backpacking adventures around the world. Veronique hung back in order to call her boyfriend back home, so Katie and I said goodbye and then hit the trail.",
          "Todays trail would take us up and over light-brown mountains and hills, and along dried river beds that at some point in the year must hold massive flowing rivers. It was nice to have an alternative to walking on the road though. We also crossed over several suspension bridges as we descended out of the mountains.",
          "It felt like a long day of ups and downs, with not much variation in the landscape around us. This part of the trail was also much much emptier as people usually take a jeep from Muktinath instead of walking the rest of the circuit, and it shows. There were decidedly fewer places to stay on this second half.",
          "A few hours later and we were in the town just before Marpha. Katie and I grabbed some lunch together before saying goodbye. As we ate we saw Veronique walking by. After saying goodbye to Katie I did my best to try and catch up to Veronique. I was nervous about being alone again on the trail after 11 days of walking with the same group of people.",
          "In the town of Marpha I found a place to stay by myself. It wasn't the best place, and there was no one else there. I got settled in and went out to walk the little village. There wasn't much to see, but as luck would have it I ran into Veronique and she said she had found a great place to stay. We went back and packed up my stuff and set off for this other place. It had a friendly host, and comfy beds, but I was most excited for not having to hike along tomorrow."

          "Probably the most memorial day on trail for me. My original destination for today was going to be Tatopani, but when we got there it was mostly locals, no other hikers, and I would finally be alone since the last member of my group would be catching the bus back to Pokhara. So I decided to follow an Australian couple who were doing the circuit to Ghorepani.",
          "The way down from Ghasa was fast. We were now within the jungle biome once more, and it was getting warm fast. A large river was flowing next to us as we descended down the trail and crossed over suspension bridges. It only took about 2.5-3 hours to get down to Tatopani, the traditional endpoing point of the trek. I debated staying here, and continueing on tomorrow and starting the Annapurna Basecamp trek since I had tons of extra time due to it not taking as long as I had thought to do the circuit. But the Australian couple we had met last night at the place we stayed in Ghasa were continuing on today, and since it was so early in the day I figured why not keep going?",
          "Initially we were all hiking together, but they were much faster at going up and so after a while I told them to go on ahead and that I would meet up with them at the place we had decided upon at lunch in Tatopani.",
          "I was walking alone now, but the trail was well-marked. There were a lot of elevation gains happening today, nearly 4,000 feet of it, all since Tatopani. I had stopped seeing other hikers on the trail for a while now, and it wasn't until the sun started to go down that I started to catch up to some who had started off from other places along this trail.",
          "I hadn't had anything to eat since lunch time, and even then it wasn't much, and I was also out of bars to snack on. I had plenty of water though. As the sun went down the temperatures started to drop, but I didn't notice. I was too tired and too full of andrenaline to care. I was wheezing by this point though, and every step was a struggle. Eventually I came to the archway that marked the entrance to Ghorepani, but the universe was feeling extra cruel that day because even though I was \"here\" I still had to ascend several flights of stone stairs in order to get to the places to stay.",
          "As I walking on and up, I came to the place that the Australians and I had earlier agreed upon. It was empty. It had been shutdown and shuttered for some time, and by the looks of it was not going to open any time soon. This was not good. I could see other places to stay in the distance, more close the center of the village. I pushed on and entered the first place that I came to. It was busy, in fact this whole village was bustling with activity from other hikers. Makes sense since there is a day-hike here you can do called Poon Hill.",
          "I stumbled into the building and asked for a room at the front desk. I must have been in bad shape, or maybe it was because I had arrived so late in the evening, but I got a lot of stares when I entered. The host of the place showed me to a room with a single bed in a building that had some thin walls. I asked them for some snacks to eat (I was starving) and a blanket since I was cold, and then they left. I sat down on the bed and that was when things really started to go bad.",
          "Nearly instantaneously my arms from my elbows to my hands, and my legs from my knees to my feet, started to tingle and go numb. I didn't know what this could mean (I thought I was just really tired), and I sat there hoping it would wear off and stop on its own. It did not. Nervous, I struggled down the stairs and headed to the front desk asking for a blanket and some snickers bars. They said they would bring one up, so I headed back upstairs with my snickers and sat on the bed and snacked and waited.",
          "About five minutes later they arrived with the blanket. I must have been in shock because I told them I couldn't feel my arms and legs and they said that's because you are cold and need to warm up. I followed them back downstairs and they cleared a spot for me on a bench next to the open fireplace. I wrapped the blanket around me and sat their shivering, waiting for the fires to heat me up. If it wasn't for what happened next I probably would have died.",
          "A group of hikers were sitting at a table next to the windows, and one of them kept glancing over at me. After a few moments they came over and asked what was wrong. I said I was cold and shivering and they asked if I had changed out of my hiking clothes that had been soaked in sweat all day. I said no and they asked if I had a change of outfit, to which I said yes. They immediately picked me up by the arms and brought me to my room where they helped me change into dry clothing. They then grabbed my sleeping bag and brought me back down to the fireplace. He orderd some hot salty soup for me to drink/eat, along with more snickers bars. After eating I laid down on the bench and fell asleep next to the warm fire in my sleeping bad.",
          "A couple of hours later I awoke, in a bit of a daze but doing much better. The hiker checked in on me and asked if I was ok. I thanked them immensly, and headed upstairs to go to sleep. While laying in bed I used my phone and the teahouses wifi and googled my condition. I found out that I had minor hypothermia, and if it wasn't for the intervention of those hikers, I would have died.",
          "Words can't describe how I feel about that situation, and what happened. It was a series of bad decisions, one after the other. I was lucky to be alive."

After a short while I heard some noises in the trees, and looked up to see monkeys swinging from the branches! It was an awesome sight, but for some reason I was nervous about them being aggressive and I quickened my pace.",

Fresh snow must have fallen last night, because the trail was hard to find, and I ended up doing a little bit of bushwacking as I made my way. Up ahead though I could see the Basecamp refuge as clouds started to fill the world around me. More snow was coming, but I had made it just in time.",

          "The snow storm lasted for a few hours, and after it passed the skies were a crystal-clear blue with some remaining clouds scooting along the surface in a weird fog/cloud-inversion mix. I took this opportunity to walk around a bit and checkout a dropoff nearby that had some great cloud-inversion going on.",
          "I made a lot of progress on my book today, seeing as how I had arrived by late morning. A couple of dogs that lived around the refuges (not sure if they had owners) kept trying to sneak into the dining hall to get out of the cold and to beg for food, but the hosts kept shooing them out.",
          "During lunch and dinner I made some friends with a couple of Americans from Colorado and Washington. They seemed like decent people. After the sun set there wasn't much more reading I could do in the dim lights of the dining hall. Didn't matter though, I wanted to go to bed early in order to wake up to see the sunrise."

          "We awoke in the dark pre-dawn hours, stiff from sleeping on hard mattresses and in this cold world. After bundling up in all my layers I headed outside and started following the others as they headed towards the Annapurna mountain and to a large flat area above the refuges for optimal viewing.",
          "I love seeing the sunrise in the mountains, and this one did not dissapoint. Not a cloud in the sky as it turned from dark blues to bright pinks. The mountains around us started to glow golden before we could see the sun rise. Their tips looked like they were on fire as the sun struck them and stirred up the snow at their peaks.",
          "After being out there for over an hour we all headed back to the dining hall for a nice hot egg breakfast with hot cocoa. I had decided to go all the way back down to Chomrong today given that I had nearly gone all the way up to Basecamp in almost a single day. Folks that I had dinner with two days prior in Chomrong had said it only took them a day as well to come down from Basecamp.",
          "The first part of the trail was slow going due to the snow that had fallen yesterday, and all of the compacted snow underneath that was now as slick as ice. Probably an hour later and I was out of the snow regions and heading through bushes and scraggly grasses, passing all of the things I had gone by yesterday.",
          "I didn't take many pictures today as I raced down the trail. I was motivated partly by thinking of getting a nice room to myself again at the place I had stayed at previously in Chomrong, and their awesome pizza, but I was also partly motivated by the fact that there weren't many people coming down or up the trail today, and I had a slight semi-unrational fear of tigers that lived in the area.",
          "Towards the end of the trail, before the big descent and ascent back up to Chromong, more people started to appear. I must have gotten a really early start, or was just way ahead of the others.",
          "The descent wasn't so bad, a bit slow going given that I was starting to get low on energy, and my knees could use the break. I took a brief rest at the bottom before having to walk up the hundreds/thousands of stairs going up to the upper area of Chomrong.",
          "As I went up there were some horses blocking the path that I went around, and then later on some scary looking bulls with big horns that didn't seem to give a second thought to me being on the trail, and kept marching down at full speed. I had a flashback to my scary cow encounter in Switzerland, and quickly jumped up on top of some large boulders as the bulls came walking through where I had been standing a moment ago.",
          "Freshly full of andrenaline I continued up the stairs towards the places to stay. The place I had in mind didn't have any rooms available as it was now early afternoon, and so I continued on seeing what places looked welcoming. I found one a little higher up the stairs which wasn't fun to keep going up, but nevertheless I made it and got a room to myself on the second floor with a view of the valley below.",
          "Turns out some of the people I had met at the dining hall in Basecamp yesterday were staying here as well, and I also befriended a father-daughter pair from England. We all ate dinner together (this place had pizza, but it sadly wasn't as good as the other place.), and talked about life in our different countries. The people from England had a non-London accent and it was really hard to understand them.",
          "Tonight would be my last night on trail, and I was sad to be leaving the mountains behind and having to go back to Pokhara and the bustle of a crowded city."

          "Today would be a really short day. I set off early in the morning just after breakfast and began the mostly downward trail towards a jeep station where I would hitch a ride back to Pokhara. I did however enjoy a nice sunrise on my little private balcony.",
          "Not many people were on this part of the trail today as I passed through several small groupings of teahouses and through bright green scenery. There were a few areas where I had to walk on a road, but luckily no vehicles came through. Lots of lovely trees in this area though.",
          "I was making good time, now eager to get back to my stuff at the Hostel, and a hot shower. I had decided, last night, to book a different hostel that looked much nicer and that offered excursions such as paragliding.",
          "The jeep station was a simple place that offered cold drinks and a shaded area with benches to wait at while a car arrived. I didn't have to wait long though. The journey back to Pokhara was split up into two parts: the first was the jeep ride down the rough mountain dirt road (the car was bouncing all over the place). We had to wait for a little bit at one point as crews worked to clear a fresh landslide. The second part of the journey came after the jeep went about halfway down the mountain, and was on paved roads. Here they pulled into a parking lot and I was transferred to a pre-paid taxi that took me the rest of the way down to Pokhara.",
          "My adventure in the Himalayas was done. This was an amazing experience. I met some amazing friends that I keep in touch with, and had saw some amazing things. The world and culture of the Himalayas is very pleasant and relaxing. I wish I could keep doing this forever. And not to mention the near-death experience a few nights ago. This will go down as one of my favorite experiences and places, and maybe someday I'll work up the courage to come back and attempt the Everest Basecamp trek that is also very popular."

      "In the Dolomites of Northern Italy there are a series of seven trails collectively known as the Alta Via routes. This is a thru-hike of one of those trails: the Alta Via 1 (the most classic of the collection). Winding its way over 65 miles from North to South, this high route reached a maximum altitude of 9,129 feet and took 10 days to complete, while passing through a panorama of jagged ridges, vertical walls, and majestic towers, culminating in some of the most beautiful landscapes in the world."

          "My friend Cerstin and I caught an early morning shuttle bus from town we were staying in to Lago Brais, the official starting point of the Alta Via 1. The bus was filled with the backpacks of other hikers, and we had to stand as we made our way along the road. The shuttle dropped us off in front of a hotel on the lake, an idyllic starting point.",
          "Lago Brais is an Instagram-worthy location, with a beautiful turqouise mountain lake laying at the feet of majestic white-gray mountains. There was a little dock with a small shack at the end of it, and a line of old wood canoes all tied up. We explored as much of the lake as we could, but it was too big to go all the way around, and we had some hiking to do.",
          "The trail follows along the lake for some time, staying on mostly level ground and not gaining any real elevation. The real trail, and ascent into the mountains, awaited us when we got to the other end. Loose fallen rocks awaited us underfoot as we turned away from the lake and began our trek south.",
          "Once we started heading up, the incline steadily increaseed, and before long we were already taking breaks to catch our breath. Up and up we went along well-marked trails, stealing glances back at the lake as a way of judging how far we had gone, and how high up we were getting. About an hour later the lake was out of sight, and we were surrounded by mountains.",
          "There were some pretty sweet views at the top of the initial ascent. Rolling hills made of pushed up rock from tectonic forces filled our fields of view. I had never seen such interesting rock formations. Some looked like regular mountains, while others looked as if someone pushed a mountain onto its side and then smoothed it out. They were extending into the sky at all sorts of odd angles. Some even looked like they had their tops cut off.",
          "Maybe an hour and a half went by of going up and down these interesting rock formations before we got our first glimpse below of the place that we would be spending the night at: Rifugio Bella. It looked so small when set against the backdrop of these mountains.",
          "But before we turned to head for the rifugio, we decided to do a side trek up the nearby mountain. About 90 minutes later and we were at the top, and it was worth it. It seemed like we covered a lot of distance today, however this was not the case, it was all mostly vertical, because far below us was the Lago Brais, the place we had started at, although it was very small from up here.",
          "We maybe spent close to an hour at the top before the cold wind finally got to us, and we started our descent down to the rifugio. An hour later and we were all checked in. The beds were spacious and comfortable, and the dinner was superb! After dinner we hung out drinking and talking with our new friends! Time flew by and before we knew it it was already 9:30 pm. The sun was already beginning to set",
          "As the sun was setting, I stepped out of the mountain rifugio. I stood there as the sun set, watching the skies turned a deep purple. As the temperature slowly dropped, I stared at the silhoutes of the mountains surrounding me. This is where I belonged, being in the mountains. As I stood there a little fox went scampering by, bringing food back to its den.",

And even then the servings are small and unsatisfying. But on the Alta Via 1 the breakfasts have more to them, such as eggs!",
          "I thought the views from the first day were great, but on the second day they got even better. As soon as we left the rifugio we were immersed once more in open rolling land surrounded by all sorts of geologic formations. Truly, I have never seen so much variety before.",
          "We walked and hiked over grassy hills as the trail took us towards mountains in the far distance. About an 70 minutes later we transitioned from open, rocky, fields to forests thick with pine trees and various other conifers. While the trail has been mostly small ascents and descents up until this point, it now turned towards a massive descent that had wooden railings protecting us from the dropoffs on our right. We were descending down the side of a mountain and into a valley.",
          "Upon reaching the valley floor we were greeted with the sight of a rifugio in the distance that offered a sunny peaceful place to rest and drink and eat a second breakfast. But an hour later we decided that it was time to move on, and leave this idyllic valley behind, and regain the elevation we had just lost by heading into a different portion of the mountains.",
          "Here the ground was a bit sandier, maybe due to the variety of composition of the rocks around us. It almost felt like someone had dropped a beach right into the middle of the path. Could have been an old lake bed as well for all we knew. Lots of switchbacks in this area, which on a full belly wasn't the most fun.",
          "With blue partly cloudy skies, and towers of mountains around us, we pressed on and happened upon a river flowing just beyond a small family farm house. No livestock around so we felt safe taking off our shoes and dipping our feet into the ice-cold waters. What a feeling that was.",
          "Shortly thereafter we arrived at our place for the night: Rifugio Lavarella. It was situated on a little lake/pond, with watery features all over the property, and some cows grazing around it.",
          "Another fabulous dinner in a fabulous place-of-stay. This Alta Via 1 trek has the best food so far out of all the treks I've done to date. We chilled on the patio under umbrellas watching the clouds flow by and some took naps. It was a very relaxing locale."

          "The trail took us away from the lake/pond and into the woods. It gained elevation quickly, and before long we were up and above trees. Good timing as well since a little bit of cloud inversion was beginning to move in. The path left the trees behind and we were once again walking through rolling green hills littered with rocks of all shapes and sizes.",
          "Our group was 6 strong today: Myself and my friend Cerstin, along with two mother-daughter pairs from the States. We kept the same pace mostly, but eventually one of the mother-daughter duos had some extra gas in the tank on an ascent later on and took off.",
          "We passed lakes, empty cattle pens, crossed rivers, and skirted around massive boulders strewn about the land. At some point we happened upon a cave in the middle of the rock face, but upon further investigation it appeard to be nothing spectacular. Onwards we marched towards what seemed like the edge of the world in the distance.",
          "Before us, on either side, rose great walls of rock divided in the middle by a forested valley. At the edge of this forested valley there appeared to be a massive drop off, which usually meant steep decline (not so great for the knees). However, we first had to climb up the left side of this valley before we could make our descent. It took us about an hour of huffing and puffing to make it up to the top. There was still snow up there!",
          "Once at the top we were able to see the path drop off and head down some steep-looking switchbacks towards a lake below. From our point of view it looked as if it was a straight drop down, which didn't seem fun. Thankfully, it wasn't that bad. The visibility up there was amazing though: we could see the trail for tomorrow stretch out in front of us.",
          "On the way down, as we approached the lake from above, a true wall of rock rose up to our left, and it dominated the local landscape. At the end of this wall it seemed that the world once again just dropped off.",
          "We took a break at the lake in order to dip our feet in and pose for some photos. We weren't alone at this lake though, because a field trip full of kids was everywhere. That's one thing I've noticed about this trek so far: it's very accessible, you can practically drive to any point on it if you wanted. It wasn't a very \"remote\" hike, not like the Tour du Mont Blanc at least.",
          "There were some stone ruins just beyond the lake, which I always love checking out. And our place for the night was visible in the distance, even if we had to go down a big chunk. There was a nice wide river/waterfall that paralleled the trail as we descended, which meant a great chance to get some fresh (filtered of course) water.",
          "Some ruined World War II barracks and ammunition depots met us at the bottom of our descent as we made our approach to Rifugio Scotoni. This was a nice little place with comfortable rooms with a view, and a nice patio where we would have dinner later on. Clouds and rain moved in during the late afternoon, which gave us all a good excuse to chill and nap.",
          "Amazing views of the stars at night from here! We had some beers on the patio at night and watched them go by for a bit."

          "Since we descended so much yesterday in order to get to the rifugio, we had to ascend right out of the gate this morning as we passed by the WWII ruins from yesterdays trail. I want to say that it took about an hour and a half in order to complete the initial ascent. However long it took, we were so high up that we were walking on snow.",
          "Today had a little bit of everything in terms of landscapes and environments. After crossing the snowy portions at the beginning there was a bend in the trail and we went around a mountainside that was the most red-brown rock/dirt that I have ever seen. It was also littered with anti-avalanche fencing meant to hold the snow back, or at least I think that's what they were for.",
          "Once we finished going around the bend in the trail, the red-brown rock/dirt gave way to white stone and green grasses growing along the mountainside. We took in the views as we continued following the trail markers. Then came a junction in the trail, and no one seemed to know which way to go. Even the paper maps weren't much of a help. Needless to say, we took a wrong turn.",
          "But it was a pretty cool wrong turn, simply because we got to walk next to this massive boulder that was just sitting there, almost like it was guarding the way. We were also treated to some pretty cool sights of a valley in the distance. We turned around and went back to the junction, and this time took the correct route that took us along a very thin strip of land around the base of a dome-like mountain.",
          "More interesting looking ruins and caves along the way today as well. In the distance we could see Citta de Fume, and another mountain that looked like it had it's head chopped off.",
          "White/gray rock transitioned to green fields as we finished the route along the base of the dome-like mountain and began a series of moderate switchbacks. It's a good thing I had the knee braces on or else I would have been far worse off. We were met with thick conifer forests at the end of the switchbacks, and the trail took us to a restaurant in the woods with a patio overlooking the tree- tops.",
          "If I haven't already mentioned it, the food on this trek is the best so far, and that's most likely due to the fact that these places are accessible by motor vehicles. I know that ruins the remoteness of it, but it does mean each place has a full kitchen and delicious foods to choose from. Case-in-point, I had a beer, salad, and burger with fries topped with an egg at this restaurant. Yum!",
          "The next two hours, after leaving the restaurant, were filled with walking through forests, with some fleeting glimpses every now and then of the many mountains that were surrounding us, and a couple of road crossings. Finally we began to ascend out of the forests towards more familiar rocky terrain, and our destination for the night: Rifugio Averu.",
          "Averu stood at the top of a rocky mountain slope with a steep drop-off on the other side that provided some great views from the dining hall windows. This place also had the fanciest meals on this trek, complete with hardboiled eggs for breakfast! We definitely stuffed our bellies full at this place. I think I actually gained weight on this trek."

          "Today's hike would be filled with so many amazing views and visuals, from mountain silhouettes and cliffs that looked like something out of Pandora from Avatar, to crazy earthly formations of green. And it all got started with a full moon during breakfast in the lovely dining room of Rifugio Averu.",
          "A bit of backtracking was required today in order to continue our trek. If we didn't, then we would have had to have gone down some via ferreta's-like ladders which require a solid stomach when it comes to the dropoffs, and a helmet to protect against falling rocks. Needless to say, this wasn't in our plan, nor did we have any helmets.",
          "We made our way down back onto the trail and headed off into the greenness. I usually steal looks behind me as I hike just in case I spot something that I would have otherwise missed since I was going in a different direction. Today was one of those days, and I'm sure glad I did. This particular part of the Dolomites had so much unique looks to it: massive boulders, floating in the clouds, and a rock formation that seemed to be a throne fit for the gods.",
          "The trail today took us down and up and down and up. We passed some larger groups (20+ people) going in the opposite direction as us. It was a weekend day, I think, so maybe they were just out for a group hike. It meant a lot of stop- and-go though, waiting for them to pass. There were also some busy roads that we had to cross today.",
          "Once we passed the roads and left the larger groups behind, it was down to just the backpackers on the trail. This is where I saw some of the aforementioned amazing geological features. They definitely make this a unique hike. There was even a set of ruins hovering, seemingly, on the edge of thin air. Curved mountains pushed on their sides, mountains with the tops cut off by clouds, and endless green in all directions. What a beautiful day of hiking!"

          "Today's portion of the trek started off with a stretch through a very green pine wood, with a bit of walking on a shoulder of a road. There was also lots of leaping between large rocks that were strewn over portions of the trail. We all played a bit of leap frog this morning with eachother due to us moving at different speeds and getting a different start time this morning.",
          "While the forest was a very lush looking green, it wasn't all that eventful. There weren't many lookout points, and we weren't doing much in terms of elevation. After we finished walking along the shoulder of the road, and got out of the woods, that's when the views started to roll in. The trail also took us up to a ridge where there some old WWII anti-aircraft guns left around as a monument.",
          "We didn't know it but there was an ultra marathon race in the area we were hiking.",
          "The land around us was covered in lush green fields and forests, and criss- crossed by a handful of trails in white, standing out in stark contrast to the green around us. It was time though to start switchbacking up a mountain while staying out of the way of the marathoners who were cascading down its sides. It's amazing none of them twisted an ankle as they leaped from rock to rock.",
          "At the top of the mountain there was a full-service hut with a rudimentary cable car-like thing for sending supplies up and down. Pretty cool looking. We hung out for a short amount of time to get a drink, and then started down the other side as the slower marathoners were making their way up towards us. Such a crowded day on trail.",
          "There was a lake at the bottom that we explored momentarily, but there weren't any good places to sit and dip your feet in given that it was a mostly sandy shore, so we continued on around the lake through the throngs of marathon walkers and runners. Another magnificent sheer wall of mountain and stone greeted us around the other side of the lake as we crested over a small hill.",
          "Rain clouds were starting to move in, so we quicked our pace as we went up and down over small hills and rocky embankments as the trail weaved its way through the mountainside terrain. Luckily it didn't not rain much, only a fine misting here and there.",
          "Eventually the trail turned to the right and we started to ascent once more up to our place of rest of the night: Rifugio Tissi. It was perched on the edge of a cliff overlooking a good-sized town around a lake below. These were some epic views from up here: the tall wall of mountains on one side, and this perilous dropoff to the other overlooking the tops of other mountains and the town.",
          "After dinner we watched the sun set from this cliff overhang, it was a truly beaufitul sight. We stayed up there for hours, until the stars came out. We even spotted Jupiter, which was especially bright around this time of the year."

          "Our way out of Rifugio Tissi took us back down towards the place we entered from yesterday afternoon, and off in the opposite direction. We walked along \"The Wall\", as I've come to call it, for a brief period of time before entering a gathering of small pine trees. Soon after we exited into a cleared valley and up ahead we sawa big ole herd of cows.",
          "These cows could care less about us, which was good considering my last cow encounter resulted in me nearly having a heart attack and probably scaring that cow half to death. We walked with them, or rather they walked with us, passed some stone ruins (probably an old herders home) up until a small wire fence blocked them from going any further, and we were on our own again.",
          "Another pine forest awaited us, tucked within spires of mountains that looked like chimney stacks. Ahead I saw a waterfall turning into a river that went off into the distance, but we ended up crossing over the top of the waterfall, instead of below it. Shame, that would have made for some good photo-ops.",
          "It took us maybe an hour to get through the main forest part, and then the trail started to ascent towards the face of the mountains that were surrounding this area. Within the nooks and crannys of them I could see huge piles of snow hiding in the shadows and trying to hold out for as long as it could.",
          "Eventually the trail came to a bend around the mountain side, and we passed through a little gap that reminded me of the Lord of the Rings. We met a new travelling companion here who was also German, and was doing a much longer trek through the Alpes and Dolomites which shared part of its trail with the Alta Via 1.",
          "After this bend in the trail it was finally time to start descending, and it was a beautiful descent through a decidious forest that had plenty of stumps and rocks strewn about, plus some wooden benches for sitting on. I took a break here (I had pulled ahead of everyone else during the descent), and as a sat there a butterfly came and rested on my backpack.",
          "The others eventually caught up and we all chilled for a bit. It wasn't much further now until our next resting point: Rifugio Carestiato. It was perched on a rocky outcrop that provided a very nice view of a valley below us, and the clouds flowing past the mountains in the distance. The presence of the forest meant there weren't many areas for exploring around the rifugio, so it was a pretty calm evening full of drinking and playing cards and eating."

The trail today was a nice mixture of forests, ascending and cross cols between mountain tops, and passing what I can only presume are old military barracks built of stone.",
          "We started off through the trees after leaving the rifugio and walking across grassy fields which offered some amazing views, but shortly there-after we had to walk on a road as we descended. Luckily the trail didn't hang out on the road for long and we were back in the trees. Saw some cool looking ruins in there as well.",
          "The woods left us behind as the trail took a turn and the vegetation gradually thinned out as we headed onto some exposed scree fields. More great views though! But it sure was hot today without the trees or clouds to block the sun. After a while of going across the scree field, and through more small pine trees, we came to a grassy clearing that had an old hut with a water trough that was still working. We filled up our bottles and kept moving.",
          "Our views today mostly consisted of mountains in the distance, and small pine tree forests. But as we came around a bend in the trail after going through some bushes and other vegetation we came across some pretty neat looking stone ruines. They looked too big to be someones old home, so my guess is that they were left overs from World War II. I tried to explore them as much as possible but the vegetation within had grown too thick.",
          "Afterwards the trail took us to a crest with some nice views, and then narrowed as it turned down into a pine tree and bush forest. I remember racing through this area because of the heat and the smell of pine was overwhelming. Rifugio Pramperet was also visible in the distance, and I was craving a shower, and some lunch. The dormitories were set along one wall with a courtyard in the middle, a nice spot for eating outside.",
          "The front balcony had lots of tables with umbrellas, and the inner dining hall was a good size as well. A special after-dinner treat (which the dinner itself was amazing, as they all have been on this trek) involved a Moose coming to visit us! It didn't get very close, but close enough for us to see pretty well. We also watched the sun set behind the mountains."

          "We desended for a short while, but then quickly started ascending towards some cols between peaks. The stone was very white in this area, punctuated by dark green bushes and vegetation. This wasn't an easy climb, lots of stopping to catch my breath. But it felt good to be high up once more, instead of going through thick forests.",
          "Lots of ice fields up top as well, with views for days of the surrounding mountains that were wreathed in white clouds. It felt like standing on the edge of the world at some points. After about an hour and a half of straight ascent, we came to the top and took a much deserved break.",
          "Our route now took us down between two mountain peaks that looked like they had been split down the middle by lightening, and then pushed open in order to make a way for us to get through. Another wall of rock though greeted us in the distance and flanked us on our left as we walked. We thought we also spotted some deer, or moose, at the top of the wall but they were too far away for us to see, or even be sure. But we did have a lot of marmots to keep us company as we walked through a grassy field full of dandelions.",

The trail at this drop-off was full of switchbacks, and it was a long way to go through them all, but eventually we came to the bottom and to our place for the night.",

We got an early start in order to make sure we had plenty of time to catch that bus, otherwise we would have to figure out another way of getting into town. There was another cable car for re-supply at this rifugio, and I thought about taking it down instead of walking.",
          "Most of the first part of the morning was spent going laterally instead of vertically. There was an initial descent from the rifugio but then it became a straight shot acoss the mountains before we started going down. I turned back for one last look and the whole area looked like something out of an idyllic dream.",
          "I was on the hunt for the Edelweiss flower as someone last night had told us this was a good area to spot some. Alas, I did not spot any today. We travelled over trails cut into the side of moss and grass-covered mountains. Clouds started to roll in shortly thereafter. It further increased the dream-like quality of the day.",
          "Forests started to dominate our view as we left the scraggly tree-less upper elevations behind and descended down steep zig-zagging switchbacks. We were going different speeds so we all spread out and got separated. But about halfway down there was a rifugio that had an open kitchen and, most importantly, bathrooms. We ate last nights pie leftovers as a snack. Beforelong we were ready to keep going.",

          "On the way I spoke with some other hikers who had the GR20 (Grande Randonnee 20) in Corsica, France and I asked if I was someone who could do it, given that I had read it was the hardest hike in Europe. They said \"Yes, of course! If you can do this hike then you can do that one, it's no different.\" This made me feel more confident about doing it, but sadly it would still be nearly 5 years before I decided to conquer it.",
          "We finished the thru-hike around 11 am. It was an unceremonious ending, it was just a bus stop on a road somewhere after all. But behind the bus stop area was a very wide river with a rocky beach, and we took the opportunity to ditch our backpacks and stick our feet in the cold water. Each one of us nearly slipped into the cold water as we tried to venture our into the flowing waters.",

      "Encircling the Mont Blanc mountain in the Alps, the tour of this peak is a classic long-distance hike covering a distance of 106 miles while passing through France, Italy, and Switzerland. It offered a challenging experience filled with diverse landscapes, a unique blend of cultures, and stunning alpine charm across 12 days of hiking, all while sleeping in comfy mountain huts and eating warm home-cooked meals each night. The unofficially highest point on the trek, via an alternate route, was 8,998 feet.",
      "The sights from the trail, and at the mountain huts, are beautiful and well worth the 36,877 ft of total elevation gain and 36,701 ft of total elevation loss."

          "I’ve done a few day hikes before in the Andes mountains of South America. These included Torres del Paine in Patagonia, and San Jose de Maipo outside of Santiago, Chile. Each had around 600 meters of gain. But this was my first time actually hiking into, up, and over mountains.",
          "This would be my second time in France, and Europe. My arrival into Les Houches, France on the previous day was delayed until the late evening hours. But being back in backpacking mode made me feel at home.",
          "Dinner was in full swing when I showed up.",
          "The host seated me at a table with a group of French speaking folks. They knew very little English, but tried their best to make me feel welcomed. All of us were here for the same reason: to hike the Tour du Mont Blanc.",
          "Tour du Mont Blanc is a 170 kilometer (105 mile) circuit around the Mont Blanc massif with an approximate height gain and loss of 10,000 meters (32,800 feet). It takes you through France, Italy, and Switzerland while you spend the nights at various mountain huts and refuges.",
          "A chilly morning treated me to cloud covered views of Les Houches which sits above a valley. The views distracted me so much, that I realized I was going the wrong way. Embarrassed, I returned to the proper route up and out of the town. Barely 10 minutes had gone by before I was ascending earthen steps up and into the surrounding hillside.",
          "The clouds hung around for about an hour, and made my first experience of this place absolutely magical feeling.",
          "Gravel paths, wood steps, and paved roads led me higher and higher. Col de Voza was the first stop along the trail. It provided a great view back down into the valley from which I had climbed.",
          "The alternate route that I had chosen before embarking on this trek took me up through forests with amazing views of the valley beyond.",
          "Here I would get my first taste of having to scramble over rocks that covered what you could loosely call a trail while using a steel cable bolted into the rock. The drop off was so steep, that I quickly realized that this tour does not mess around.",
          "Several signs warned us along the way that this was the “dangerous” route. Hell yeah, I thought. Bring it on. I would get what I asked for a short while later.",
          "More narrow paths, steel cables, and rocks kept me moving towards a rushing river that flowed down from the snow covered top of the mountain. The entrance to the bridge that crossed this river was precipitated by water covered rocks, and I slipped on them while trying to find my way down.",
          "After crossing the river I was climbing once more up and over rocks and steep switch-back trails.",
          "The elevation and thin air were starting to take its toll on me: each breath I took became shorter and harder. I found myself taking huge gasping breaths and had to stop to catch myself every 15 minutes.",
          "I started feeling nauseous as I hiked up the side of the Col de Tricot. I pulled out my last energy bar to give my stomach something to chew on while I pushed up and up.",
          "The top did not let me down. Here I was at 2120 meters above sea level, and could see a whole world set out before me.",
          "The climb down was a long series of very steep zigzags. Most of the other backpackers were going down quickly, but I had to go slowly due to my knees. They never fully healed since the Camino nearly three months ago.",
          "In the valley below me stood the small Chalets de Miage. I arrived nearly two hours later, and grabbed lunch. It was already 2pm and my destination was further ahead.",
          "Even though I was happy to have gone up to the top of the stage, and come back down again, I still had to put another 300 meters of gain under my belt before I could call the day done.",
          "At 3:30 pm I found myself at my place of residence for the night at Auberge de Truc. It was a true mountain refuge. Their milk came from the cows they owned, there were no lights in the dormitory, outhouse bathroom, or at the sinks, and there were no showers.",
          "But none of that mattered. I did this, I accomplished all of this, and that was the best feeling in the world.",
          "One of the things that I loved most about the Camino was the people you met. This trip had the same aspect to it. Dinner was around 7pm in the evening, and I got to meet a couple from Germany, a man from South Korea, and a lady from Spain.",
          "The setting sun called us outside after dinner. It was striking the top of Dome de Miage and covering it in the brightest pink and orange colors that I’ve ever seen on a mountain.",
          "Life in the mountains is so peaceful and quiet. The sound of the cowbells didn’t even bother me, and helped to play a soothing role in putting me to sleep later that night."

          "This was only the second day, and the second highest elevation point I’ve ever been to, so it was a rough hike up to the Col de la Croix. The pictures do not capture the steepness of the trail. I would be walking, hiking, and pulling myself up through all different types of things today.",
          "Mountain sleeping is some of the best sleeping that I’ll ever have. My bunk was next to the door, so I had to contend with people going in and out to use the bathroom in the middle of the night, but the cold air helped me sleep. I also had an empty bunk next to me, so I didn’t have to worry about someone snoring in my face.",
          "Since I stayed up high last night, I had to start the day by descending down 750 meters to the city of Les Contamines below. It only took about an hour and half to descend through the winding roads and twisting trails. I got lost twice as I tried to find my way into the city center.",
          "The way out of town went through a forest that followed a river for most of the way. It was a shallow trail, not much gain in elevation. Saw one of the cutest houses that I’ve ever seen next to the chapel of Notre-Dame de la Gorge.",
          "Here the trail started to go up, passing by various little waterfalls along the way. One of these watery distractions was a river of a deep blue that cut right down the middle of the forest through a canyon of its own design.",
          "Several old buildings dotted the land around the trail as I continued on. I took a short breather at Refuge Nant Borrant since I had just climbed about 500 meters. From here on out the trail would become much steeper, and the elevation gain much more rapid.",
          "Over the next hour I would hike along a gravel path, passing cows, red-roofed houses, rivers, and spotting what looked like the Torres del Paine in the distance (somehow I must have walked to Patagonia).",
          "I met up with some folks from the night before at Refuge de la Balme (1760 meters) and we all started the next steep part together. It’s always a good idea to stop and turn around every so often though, because the views behind are almost just as amazing as the views ahead. I did this many times during the steep hike, simply because I wanted to see where I had come from. This helped put todays struggle into perspective.",
          "We moved closer and closer to the clouds as we made the hike up to Col du Bonhomme. I got separated from the people I had been walking with (I can’t remember if I pulled ahead or fell behind), so I did the last couple of hours on my own.",
          "I didn’t spend much time here at this Col. It took 600 meters to get here, so I definitely took a bit of a break. I took a walk around the col, snapping pictures and admiring the view, but I knew that there was more in store for me and I would have to wait just a little bit longer on the “job well done”.",
          "The next and final Col for the day was Col de la Croix.",
          "Now came the boulders, steep drop-offs, and narrow paths. It took every last ounce of power that I had left to navigate these parts. I was in a no-fucking-around mood and did just that: powered through them.",
          "The refuge for the night was a sight for sore (literally) eyes as I started the 40 meter descent towards it. I arrived just in time before the clouds rolled in and visibility dropped to zero.",
          "Took my first cold shower tonight. What an experience that was. I’d rather go stinky than do a cold shower again.",
          "This place also ran on solar power, and since it had been cloudy all day, that meant no lights which meant using your head torch to find your way around. But it also meant eating dinner by candlelight, not too bad. I hung out with some Israelis (Barak and Neta) before dinner, and some folks from the UK, Canada, Brazil, and Ireland during dinner.",
          "Why is French bread so dry??",
          "The setting sun lit up a mountain in the distance in soft purples, and the sky behind the hills opposite it in bright oranges.",
          "Tomorrow would be the highest hike yet for me, and the most meters gained and lost so far, which could have been avoided had I known about a shortcut across the mountain top..."

          "When we reached the top nothing but mountains surrounded us. The pedestal marking the highest point on the TMB, and the various peaks in the distance, was covered in ice. But that didn't matter to us while we removed our outer layers. The valley below seemed like another world, so very far away. Today would be a marathon of hiking.",
          "The Germans and I left Bonhomme around 7:30 in the morning. Our collective goal was an Official highpoint of the TMB on the Col des Fours, and then back down. We accomplished this goal an hour later: Col de Fours at 2,665m.",
          "An optional trail offered to take us to the summit of Tête Nord de Fours in the distance, but we declined and decided to save the energy for the descent, and my own energy for the climb I would be doing later this afternoon.",
          "Steep, slanted, rock carried us down from the pedestal and back into the crevices of the mountains. Throw in a little water, and it became a slipping challenge. You can try and look graceful, but it isn’t going to happen. Fall on your butt and welcome the chance to try again.",
          "The green ground rushed up to meet us as we descended, with rivers rushing next to us falling over edges in little waterfalls. Splinters of rock began to make up most of the path floor.",
          "Cows dotted the valley below us. It was an entire field full of cowbells. They ignored us, until their owner arrived and started shouting. She was herding them towards our small group. By now our numbers had swelled from 3 to 9 as we picked up more hikers on the way down.",
          "The cows still didn’t care about us, and would have rightfully ran right through our ranks if we didn’t move out of the way. They had a place to be, and the herding dog wasn’t letting any of them get out of line, or take a break.",
          "Eventually they were above us as we continued down the narrow dirt path cut into the side of the earth.",
          "We must have missed an official turn on the path, because we ended up bushwhacking over fields, and passed by abandoned farm houses. Our trusty navigators who held The Map kept telling us to just follow this path, and we trusted them. After a few shortcuts (the path kept looping back on itself so we cut down the sides on some of the declines) we came back to a paved road which took us all the way down to Ville des Glaciers.",
          "After a short break I was forced to say goodbye to some as I needed to take a different route than they were. Most of us had the same schedules, so I knew I was going to see them again.",
          "The walk up and out of Refuge des Mottets wasn’t that bad, but I knew the worse was still to come. My home for the night was a tiny brown dot on a gray mountainside nearly 1,000 meters above me.",
          "I had to stop and breath many times as I made the ascent. Several waterfalls crossed my path, and after making good time initially I started to slow down. But, I pushed on up and over the rocks, letting cairns and rocks on the ground guide my way.",
          "See if you can spot the brown dot in the distance in the first picture Slowly but surely that tiny brown dot on side of mountain became a building. I made it to Refuge Robert Blanc. Now it was time to relax.",
          "I really wish I had brought a book with me for when I was relaxing at these refuges. The downtime at these places can feel very long and slow. There are no towns to explore, and you don’t really want to do anymore hiking or walking for the day.",
          "The clouds rolled in shortly before dinner, and covered the whole mountainside for the remainder of the night. We ate a hearty meal, and made some new friends.",
          "During dinner I found out about shortcut that went across the top of the mountains. It was the optional trail that went up to Tête Nord de Fours. It continued up and over and was a straight shot to the refuge. Oops.",
          "I love being up this high, removed from everything below. But, I had no idea just how hard tomorrows hike was going to be."

          "As eager as I was to begin hiking down and over to the Col de la Seigne, I failed to research the trail. It did not go down. Instead, it went straight across the face of Mont Tondu. Uh, ok sure, no problem, how hard can it be?Very hard is the answer.",
          "Italy was waiting for me as I strapped on the shoes and backpack.",
          "Almost immediately the path turned from rocks into dirt, but not really dirt. More like a slippery solid clay mixture that had flaked into a million pieces. Each step forced the ground out of the way as it tried to resist the force being applied to it. The feet would slip a few inches down each time I tried to stop level.",
          "Several descents did take place, but they brought me towards ever increasing obstacles.",
          "First was the 2x4 wooden beam laid across a gully that had a stream of water running underneath it with two steel ropes to hold on to as you crossed.",
          "The ground, which was solid stone now, turned from flat into slanted and bulging, making the footing tricky. The trekking poles came in handy, giving me a solid planting to push up and off from.",
          "Next came the chains that you had to climb and pull yourself up. Good thing I started doing pull-ups back at home before leaving for the trip. The third and final type of obstacle was fields of boulders with gaps in-between them. Each boulder moved just enough when you stepped on it to make you panic. The dark gaps between the rocks made you realize that they were piled high.",
          "Most of the two hour traverse of this mountainside was filled with a variation of these types of obstacles. Time and again I would get turned around, and have to search for the double yellow line marks, or a cairn, which would tell me that I was back on the right path.",
          "Finally the end of this mountainside trek was here, and it was a nearly vertical climb using steel cables the entire way. With a threshold of only a few inches, the climb zig zagged up the side of the cliff that would bring us to the Col de la Seigne.",
          "After reaching the top and pulling myself up and over onto flat, grassy, ground once more, a strange feeling washed over me. I wasn’t relieved that I had survived, no, it wasn’t that kind of feeling. It was a feeling of “I did that, I pushed myself and did that”. It was a feeling of triumph and personal best.",
          "During the morning trek, I had become separated from a pair of Golden Teapot toting Swiss-germans. They were more experienced than I was, and had sped ahead. I quickly set off on foot for the Col and to rejoin them.",
          "The col offered beautiful views back into France, and forwards into Italy. I did not stay here long since I did not see my new hiking companions. I raced down from the top. I had learned how to do fast descents on gradually sloping dirt paths in Spain (walk like a monkey, trust me), and made quick work of this part.",
          "Rifugio Elisabetta was the next resting place, but again after not seeing them, I kept going.",
          "Glaciers and mountains surrounded me as the vegetation transitioned from grass to bushes to trees. A few cow herders decided that now was a good time to let their creatures cross the path. I took an alternate route to get down to the valley floor because of this.",
          "Once I got to the valley floor I turned on the after burners. Speed walking was my jam, and I made quick work towards Lac Combal.",
          "There was no sight of them along this part though, and I decided to stop speed talking and save the speed, because more ascents were on the way.",
          "It would take another three hours of up’s and downs (mostly ups) while Mont Blanc smiled down at me. Before I realized it I was already high above the valley floor again, and the views took me by surprise. It’s hard to put these types of things in perspective until you’re either very high up or very low down.",
          "Mont Blanc decided to hide behind clouds for the entire afternoon, and I was focused the lake dotted path in front of me, especially since the cow herds had returned and were taking up most of the path. I always felt nervous when I tried to pass them.",
          "I ran out of water an hour from my destination, not good! But, I arrived safe and sound, with my reservation waiting for me. Some familiar faces gradually arrived, along with someone from Barcelona who I had met at Auberge le Truc. I also had a chance to say so-long to the Swiss-germans who were there relaxing before they would be continuing on that afternoon.",
          "The place had beautiful views of the valley that would bring us to Courmayeur. Ponies and horses lived at this refuge, and they came out to say hello. The horses also tried to get inside in order to get at the food.",
          "Dinner was delicious, the evening sky was relaxing, and the beds were comfortable. I can feel a congestion in my sinuses coming on…"

          "This day was filled with rain, but it started out bright and sunny. Most of the descent down into the skiing town of Courmayeur was a gradual transition from sandy-dirt to solid dirt, and then finally paved roads.The surrounding hills, when they were visible through the dense forest, were covered in ski lifts and ski paths.",
          "Most of the trail was in the woods, so it was very beautiful. Along the way there were small rock outcroppings that offered a humbling view of the valley below and beyond.",
          "I passed an abandoned house on the hillside, deep within the trees and right below a ski lift. I love exploring and walking around ruins, so I took a peak inside. It looked like no one had lived here for quite some time. The stairs were falling apart, and several holes were in the roof of the second floor whose own floor had long since fallen apart.",
          "Taking my time going down the trail due to the unstable nature of the material on the ground, and my poor knees, I suddenly realized that I never used the bathroom at the last place. My goal became immediately clear to me: find a public bathroom, or at the very least, a spot in the woods to squat.",
          "Luckily, I wasn’t able to find a spot in the woods so I was forced to hurry into the city center and find a toilet. The bus station had one, and I was so relieved (both literally and figuratively).",
          "The next order of business was to find snacks and an ATM because I needed to stock up on cash for the next few refuges.",
          "Having acquired cash, and food, I went up the steep road to the town square that overlooked the mountains and the old village houses below. It was a most amazing sight. These folks sure do have it good here. I grabbed a slice of pizza (or something that looked like pizza) and did some window shopping.",
          "All of the streets were filled with fancy and expensive restaurants, wine tasting rooms, and the most expensive outdoor clothing brands available. A lot of people later told me that there were some really great spas in town, but I wasn’t in the mood. I had places to be, things to do.",
          "On the way up and out of town I ran into Barak and Neta from Israel (whom I had met in Bonhomme three days earlier). We walked together up until the first mountain ascent outside of Villair. This is when the rain started to move in. Up we went and down the rain came. But I did not mind, because I absolutely love hiking in the rain. It cools you off and provides a nice sound to walk in. I mean, who doesn’t like the sound of rain falling on leaves?",
          "As usual, I had pulled ahead of everyone. When I get a destination in my mind, I push myself to reach it. At the top of the Aosta Valley I took a break at Rifugio Bertone and consumed my snacks that I had purchased 650 meters below. I waited for Barak and Neta to arrive (they had taken a break on a grassy area overlooking the city below and made coffee).",
          "The rain had started to fall more aggressively now, and we decided that it wouldn’t be safe to try for the high pass today across the Col Sapin and Pas Entre-Deux-Sauts (2436m and 2524m, respectively).",
          "We posed for pictures at the distance pedestal up here, and then started our mostly level and flat walk towards our last residence in Italy for the trip.",
          "I was thankful for the flat ground, because the rain was turning everything into mud, and I had a hard enough time staying upright, even with the sticks. We had to cross rivers, and scramble up slippery waterfall sides in order to continue on the trail.",
          "Some of them required intense negotiating skills on my part. Eventually all of the obstacles would let me cross over and continue.",
          "Along the way we passed by some ruins, and, of course, I had to stop and check them out. I wonder about who might have lived in them, and how old they could be.",
          "We also passed by an old cattle house that still smelled of fresh poop. Lovely. After going around it, I realized that the trail actually went above it and I had taken a self-created detour.",
          "One final river to cross (on a bridge this time at least), a short bend around the side of hill, and a brief 50 meter steep hike and we had arrived at our destination.",
          "Tonight would also be my second cold shower. It started off hot, but not even 30 seconds in and it turned ice cold. They had warned me that this would happen, because arriving later in the day means there is less hot water to go around. I should have soaped up first before starting the flow of water. You live and learn.",
          "Some of the folks who I had met back in Les Houches were staying here, and we were able to reconnect over dinner, along with some new faces. The clouds hung around tonight, covering the mountains. No stars this evening."

          "Most of the morning was filled with zig-zags in the trail. The walls of the valley were dotted with clumps of evergreens on one side, and the gray wall of rockslides and mountains on the other. I took every chance that I could to turn around and snap some pictures.",
          "The clouds kept a dark mood over the world around me, and I was alone for most of the first hours of the day. The river below me looked like as good a place as any to take a break. I broke out my snacks and sat there for a few moments enjoying the sounds of the water rushing by. There was a Chalet nearby that most people stopped by for breakfast.",
          "After taking in my fill of the river and the quite, I packed up and headed out for the ascent to Rifugio Elena, which was on the way up to the crest known as the Grand Col Ferret (not to be confused with the Petit Col Ferret just below it).",
          "When I arrived at the Rifugio I was forced to step inside and warm up. The wind up here were intense, and howled around every rock and wall corner. It was time to put on the extra layers for the next hike but first, a hot sandwich.",
          "I bought a toasty Bocadillo (just a sandwich really, with meat and cheese), and joined Barak and Neta at a table in the back. We tried to take some group pictures outside but the wind and cold made us look miserable in the pictures.",
          "The winds did not let up as we climbed to the top of the Col. The clouds seemed to be getting lower and lower, but it was actually us who were getting higher and higher. Here the trails seemed to go off into nothingness.",
          "At the top of the Grand Col (2537m) the clouds were racing over the ground, running into Italy behind us. If it wasn’t tied down, it would be sent running with the clouds. My first views of Switzerland (from the Alps at least) were of dirt paths and yellow grass covered hills. Once we were several dozen feet into our next country, the wind died down.",
          "Here it was quiet. Probably the quietest that I’ve ever heard in nature. No birds, no wind, no animals. Just clouds, with the sun poking through, and the views of fresh mountains. I literally didn’t hear anything for several minutes as I stood there staring in awe at the towering clouds moving across the face of a mountain to the East of me.",
          "Further along a grassy hillside appeared and provided a great spot to sit down and rest. Several other people were already here, and I tried to find a spot that wasn’t covered in dried cow poop. In the valley below us cows were being herded from one end to the other, and we watched their herd move in slow motion while listening to their bells.",
          "Finally the clouds were going away, and the bright sun was shining down on us. On the way down I had what could possibly be considered the worst fright of the trip:",
          "As I came up to a pass on the trail that went down to a farm that sold cheeses from the cows that it owned, I had to walk through a herd of gray furry looking cows. Some of them ignored you, but others were also moving down the trail at the same time.",
          "I decided to step over the wire that marked the path for the cows to take in order to stay away from them since they didn’t cross the wires. This worked until I crossed back on to the dirt path, certain that no more cows were around me. From above came the sound of a cow bell as a couple of cows had begun to make their way down the trail.",
          "One cow in particular was moving at a fast pace, and I quickened my own pace in order to stay ahead of it. I stuck to the dirt path, but the cow decided to take a shortcut over the grassy part. Our two paths crossed at the bottom of the trail.",
          "I froze in my place. The cow did not. It kept coming, at a good trot as well. At the last moment I jumped back and out of its way.",
          "Now, earlier I had said that I considered this to be the worst fright of the trip, but I think I scared the cow more than it scared me.",
          "As I jumped back it also jumped, but straight into the air. I must have startled it, and the thing must have flown at least 5 feet into the air. It continued trotting down the path after landing back on the ground. I quickly gathered myself (luckily no bodily fluids had been released), and kept going.",
          "The rest of the day, in comparison, was uneventful.",
          "Beautiful green hills and valleys, along with deep blue skies and white clouds, filled the world around me. I met some Irish girls on the way into town after crossing the river, and we helped each other get lost and found.",
          "Tonight I would be staying at Maya Joie just outside of the small town of La Fouly. Went shopping at the food market and bought stuff to make sandwiches for tomorrow. We then grabbed a beer at the bar above the food market.",
          "Dinner was a traditional Swiss dinner made from a gigantic melting block of cheese and served with potatoes called Raclette. My god was it delicious! In total I had three servings, and enough cheese for a good long while. After dinner we played scrabble.",
          "Tomorrow promises to be the easiest day so far with only 500m of total gain."

          "A backpacker that we shared dinner with yesterday at Maya Joie was going in the opposite direction, and told us about a massive waterfall after La Fouly. I was eager to check it out, and to make today just a little harder because, you know, gotta get the steps in!",
          "The way out of town was a little unsure to us, but thanks to my new Catalonian friend we found our way out. After leaving the town center, and paved road, we were immediately walking through the forest and down towards a river crossing.",
          "After the river crossing, which was surrounded by concrete walls and served as a mini dam, we were back in the woods. The sun had not fully cleared the tops of the mountains to our right as we continued Northbound and came to the path leading to the waterfall.",
          "What looked like a mostly flat path ended up being very steep and slippery, thanks to the morning dew. But the journey was well worth the reward. I had to scramble a bit near the top, just below where the water was striking the ground. I was terrified that the slightest misstep would land me in the pool of rocks and water below me. But I was able to get close enough to feel the water spraying on my face.",
          "I was tempted to stick my head into the waterfall, but scared at the last moment. It wasn’t easy moving around up there, and I had already slipped way to many times on the wet rocks trying to get close. I wasn’t going to push my luck knowing my history of clumsiness.",
          "Several of the people we knew had arrived at the bottom of the path as I was beginning to make my way down. We all walked together for the rest of the day.",
          "Most of the path went along a massive dried up river, twisting and winding it’s way through the forest. Several times the trail would leave no room for error as we crossed narrow paths which sometimes had a chain to hold on to, and a nice 100 foot drop below you.",
          "After taking a right angle turn away from the valley wall, and walking down a gently rolling path, we found ourselves entering the town of Praz-de-Fort. We were now officially in Swiss valley villages. Small village after small village greeted us as we walked a mostly paved path through the valley floor.",
          "Each house was a perfect little wooden masterpiece that evoked rest and relaxation. There was a good mix of new/modern houses, and old barn style houses that looked like they might fall over at the slightest touch.",
          "After the third village we decided to rest at a cute little bar/cafe in Issert. I gave in and bought an ice cream sandwich while we sat on the porch and stared at the greenery around us.",
          "Now it was time to begin the steepest part of the “climb”. Really it was only 1.5 hours of going up, and probably less than 500 m in total gain. We passed a cave along the way and ventured inside to explore.",
          "There were also many wood carvings in the forest on this ascent. Mushrooms (lots of mushrooms), antelope, beaver sculptures greeted us from time to time. We even passed a spot where some locals were scaling the rocky side of a mini mountain outcropping.",
          "But the arrival into Campex and its lake was easy, and before long we were all sitting down at a bar eating pizza and drinking beers. After a couple of hours it was time to make the way to our separate places of residence for the night.",
          "The day took a turn for the worse after leaving the lake behind and going our separate ways for our accommodations. I got lost, four times! Well, technically you can only get lost once, but I took four different routes to try and find the Gite that I was going to be staying at.",
          "My first attempt was to head up an alternate path that everyone swore would take me to where I needed to be, but it was an alternate path that led up to the wrong Refuge (this one was were two of the people I knew were staying).",
          "On the way down I asked an old Swiss lady whose only advice was to wave her hands in circles. I then tried to follow a river, because, you know, they lead to civilization. That didn’t work, and I ended up doubling back to the place where I had met the old Swiss lady.",
          "Finally I ran in to a group of young adults (probably in high school) and asked them where to go. Luckily one of them spoke enough English to point me in the proper direction. Thank you random group of people, where ever you are!",
          "Thankfully the Gite was a delight, and I ended up having dinner with my new South Korean friend. He tried his best to teach me basic Korean. Sadly, the only thing I remember is Annyeonghaseyo (roughly pronounced on-yo-his-ay-o).",
          "It was a delightful evening to erase the scariness of getting lost, and to learn a little bit in the process about another culture, and my fortitude in the face of adversity."

          "The sun and blue skies were out in full force today. Hiking through the woods in the early morning hours with the sun streaming through the trees is one of the most magical things that you can hope to see in nature.I took my time walking today, and made sure to see everything.",
          "The first 30 minutes were easy because I had already gone this way at least three times last night! I knew where to go, and which routes to take.",
          "Once I reached the flat ground that entered the mountains I took a break to remove my jacket and get ready. I figured it would take me a couple of hours to get to the top, but it ended up taking three.",
          "I was making for the Fenetre d’Arpette at 2,665m. This is also the other highest point on the TMB (but not an official one since it’s optional and not recommended).",
          "The first half of the trek was through woods before quickly turning into shrubs and low sparse trees. Colors of all kinds accompanied me as I crossed over rivers, pulled myself up over boulders, and went up into the mountains. I turned around once at least every 10 minutes to snap a picture of the ever increasing field of view behind me.",
          "Soon enough all forms of large vegetation where gone, and we were left with crab grass and rocks. And even then that was gone within 30 minutes and all that was left were bare rocks.",
          "The scariest part of todays hike and climb came upon me just below the summit. A field of boulders, some the size of camper vans, lay between me and my goal.",
          "I had walked/hiked over fields of small boulders a few days earlier when I had left Robert Blanc for Italy. These were different. The average size was much greater, and these guys moved a lot more than those did.",
          "I avoided all distractions (hence no pictures of this) as I went up. I kept a watchful eye out for the white and red strips that told you which way to go. Several cairns that were placed along the way also helped.",
          "At one point I had to hug a boulder the size of my bedroom as I inched my way around it.",
          "Several of these rocks also required you to climb up them, only to realize you went the wrong way, and then you had to find a scary alternate way around them.",
          "Once I got passed the field of rocks, I turned around to stay back in wonder and amazement. Second scariest obstacle had been overcome!",
          "On the way up the steep zig-zag path to the top I came upon Barak and Neta. We shared lunch and picture taking at the top, and sat there for nearly an hour, taking it all in.",
          "They say that they way down is harder than the way up sometimes, and this time they were correct. While the fight up meant dealing with shifting boulders the size of cars, the fight down meant fighting one of the steepest and sloppiest descents to date.",
          "A massive glacier (Glacier du Trient) occupied our view to the left, along with the massive smooth rock that it had created during its life.",
          "I quickly lost patience after we got through the scariest part of the descent, and started to hurry down to the river below. I started jumping down at certain parts (which is not a good idea when you have bad knees). For some reason I just wanted to be done with the descent. In total it took three hours to get down.",
          "I waited for the others to catch up at a bar near the river just outside of town. It was filled with locals, but they were used to seeing backpackers come down from the mountains.",
          "Finally, by 3:30pm we were on our way to our rest spot for the night: Refuge du Peuty. I cannot recommend this place enough.",
          "The two women who run this place make dinner for you in an old washing machine (not kidding), and play the best music during dinner which is made from ingredients grown on their property. I’m not kidding when I say that our dinner had actual flowers cooked into it."

Most of the ascent was done from within the cover of trees, so I didn’t get a good look at the receding village or valley floor as I went up.",
          "Once above the trees the views returned to me. Oh how I missed them. I don’t think I’ll ever get used to seeing the sides of mountains as they shoot towards the ground below them.",
          "Several pink flowers dotted the landscape, as well as an abandoned house, as I continued on up to the loneliest looking of buildings at the Col de Balme.",
          "It was here at Refuge du Col de Balme that the Swiss world blended in with the French world. Switzerland on one side, and France on another. Borders exist only on paper. In nature, they are invisible and there is no distinction from one side of a field to another. Except for this one, because dead ahead was the massif of Mont Blanc. It had taken nearly 9 days, but we were finally in sight of it once more.",
          "We worked our way down and across the tops of rolling hills towards the Aig des Posettes, the high point of todays hike. It was a mostly easy hike up to the top, with only minor scrambling at some points.",
          "Above us hang gliders had taken to the skies as we sat down on the rocky ground and broke out our snacks: chocolate, banana chips, more chocolate, and some nuts.",
          "I can’t believe that this trek is almost over. There’s only a few more days on the TMB. It has been an amazing experience and journey so far.",
          "The hike down wasn’t that bad, but it was just as tough as some of the others. It wasn’t long before we were safely under the cover of the trees again. The sun was high in the sky by this point and it was shaping up to be a warm day. More switchbacks as we made our way down. I was glad that the ground changed from rock to sandy dirt to leaves. It made the impact of the foot with the ground a lot easier to handle.",
          "We found our way easily enough to the Auberge for the night. I said goodbye to Laura (USA) since she was continuing on to another town and ending her hike a day early.",
          "I learned to play Taki (the Israel version of Uno), and had a good dinner with some Dutch people. Learned that tafle is Dutch for table.",
          "The setting sun lit up the sky in a bright purple, and the mountains glowed a beautiful pink."

          "Everyone told me to be weary of the ladders, that they were going to be the scariest part of the trip, and that people usually took great pains to go around them. Unfortunately for those people the alternate route that went around the ladders was closed due to a landslide last week.",
          "The sun’s rays of light were shooting out from behind the mountains as we left Tré-le-Champ and disappeared into the woods once more. This was a mostly steady gain in elevation as we navigated tree roots, and various rocky outcroppings.",
          "One of the more massive rocky obstacles was the Aiguillete d’Argentière monolith which had fallen down from the top of the mountain a long, long, time ago. It was the size of a two-story house, and the path went right around its base.",
          "After rising several more meters above the monolith’s top we came to another rocky outcropping. This one had a perfect window between the trees facing back towards the Mont Blanc range. We stood here for a few minutes watching the sun come up behind the tallest point between the trees, and watching the rays of light first point up, and then down as the sun rose higher.",
          "It would take another hour of hiking through the gradually thinning trees before coming to the first of the ladders. Along the way we spotted an Ibex in the distance hoping from rock to rock.",
          "The ladders themselves were simply just that: a series of metal ladder rungs and rods bolted into the rock in order to help hikers get up and over the terrain. They weren’t the least bit scary, but I could understand that it might be a different story if it had been cloudy. Of course everyone wanted photos of them going up them, so a line started to develop at some of them. Everyone’s butt is probably in everyones pictures.",
          "We took a break where the ladders ended, and the regular rocky path resumed. But the lakes were calling, and we wanted to get there.",
          "The first little puddle of a lake wasn’t that impressive, but the next one’s waters were so still you could see Mont Blanc reflected in its surface. We took the trail going around the back in order to take as many picture-perfect photos as possible.",
          "But it’s not just the pictures; it’s also standing there in awe of the beauty before you.",
          "Lac Blanc was another hour in front of us.",
          "These were the most turquoise green waters that I have ever seen. As soon as we found a spot to drop our gear, I disrobed down to my underwear and went for a swim. Oh my God was the water cold! It had that feeling of a thousand needles pricking your skin at once. The only way to get over it is to dive in, and that’s exactly what I did.",
          "I ended up going in twice, but only for a few moments each time. And, of course, I made someone take a picture from behind me as I looked out at Mont Blanc because yeah.",
          "Some folks made coffee while we laid out our cloths and towels to dry in the sunlight. After resting peacefully for 30 minutes we decided that it was time to get going.",
          "We arrived at Refuge de lo Flegere a couple of hours later, and straight into the middle of a spectacle.",
          "On the other side of the valley there was a little bit of smoke rising up from a structure of some sorts. Some of the people who worked for the ski lifts were watching it with binoculars.",
          "I didn’t make anything of it and we went to check in. After getting situated and showered I headed outside to sit in the sun. This is when I noticed that the little bit of smoke had turned into a full blown fire.",
          "An emergency helicopter with a basket for water was making runs back and forth between the small water reservoir just below our Refuge and the fire. It was an impressive site to see that thing cover the distance in a few seconds, drop its basket down, fill it up with water, and not 10 seconds later be heading back to drop it on the fire.",
          "It took them a couple of hours, but they finally got it under control. I had never seen anything like that before.",
          "We continued to relax in the chairs, and then play some card games while we waited for dinner. Barak and Neta wanted me to sit with them at dinner time so the hostesses put me at their table. They also put all of the other Israeli’s at this table. What are you gonna do, right?",
          "I went outside to look at the stars after dinner. I swear that I could see the band of the Milky Way above me. If there had just been a little less light pollution… But Chamonix in the valley floor below us was sparkling like a tiny jewel in the night."

I took my time leaving in the morning, and I think I was the last one to leave.I took a leisurely pace as I get on the trail walking under ski lifts, and over gently sloping forest paths.",
          "There were a couple of boulder patches blocking the path, and these ones had a much, much, steeper drop below them than the ones I had previously walked across. The pictures don’t do it justice.",
          "On the other side of the field of rocks lay a massive stone wall. It had no name, and the guidebook didn’t mention it, but it was impressive. Just after this wall we came to a red plastic pole that was in the middle of the path ahead of us.",
          "Some of the other hikers thought that it meant we couldn’t go that way, and would have to take a higher alternative route. I nearly shit my pants when the thought of having to do strenuous work today entered my mind. I thought I was passed it all.",
          "I started up the alternate path, walking more quickly than the others, and was soon far ahead of them. I was nearly at the top when I looked back and saw everyone else turning around to go along the normal path! Apparently it was open for business. I was a little upset that I had come all this way only to turn back, but in the end I was glad that I noticed them turning around.",
          "As a result of this, I was now far behind everyone. But, I would quickly catch up.",

At one point it looked like an asteroid was about to strike the mountain due to the clouds and sun playing tricks on my eyes.",
          "A short while later I came to a ski lift landing area, and saw where they had been launching all of the hang gliders! It was quite a sight to see them get their running start and jump off of the edge without hesitation.",
          "But now the hardest part of today would begin: climbing up to the top of Le Brevént at 2,526m. I was not prepared for this, but took it in stride (literally). Two hours and several more shaky rocks and ladders later I was at the top.",
          "It had an impressive view of Mont Blanc across the valley, and there was even a ski lift that came all of the way up here! Even though Mont Blanc itself was still 2,000m taller than this spot, it felt like we were even with its top.",
          "The hike down was rough, and felt never-ending. I raced down as fast as I could go, especially since there were lots of people talking and I wanted to enjoy the peace and quiet.",
          "I arrived at Bellechat two hours later, and was the first to check in. It was such a little refuge that I thought I had made a mistake in booking it, and not continuing down to Les Houches like everyone else. Luckily my fears were abated when several more people started to check in over the next couple of hours.",
          "A group of people from Holland kept my company throughout most of the evening, telling me their life story and teaching me some more Dutch words. I never knew so many European countries made English a required subject for all of their years of pre-university schooling. We played card some Dutch and English games waiting for dinner.",
          "It was very quiet up here once all of the hikers for the day had moved on, and the dinner was very delicious. After dinner they took turns telling stories about their families during World War 2.",

          "I tried to capture all of the sunrise pictures possible on the way down since the sun was looking especially orange this morning. Several Ibex also kept me company as I hiked down. On the way, I stopped by the Le Christ Roi. It was a humungous statue that came out of nowhere.",
          "I finished the last few hundred meters pretty effortlessly as I crossed over the river, and passed the train station. I was now back where I started, and it felt like a lifetime ago. My hiking boots and backpack were no longer black, but instead were covered with the dirt of several different mountainsides.",
          "The gîte that I would be staying at wasn’t open until 4pm or so, so I had some time to kill. I walked around the town, grabbed some souvenir maps, and visit all of the gift shops.",
          "On my second or third pass through the town center I ran into four other hikers that I had met along the way! We grabbed some drinks and lunch at the only open hotel bar and shared numerous stories with each other.",
          "A wicked rain storm came out of nowhere and forced us inside. But, it was time to say goodbye and go check in.",
          "After checking in I ran into people whom I had met on day 1! This was crazy! One of them lent me their free bus pass to go over to Chamonix in order to search for a pin for my backpack. I wanted to build up a collection of pins from hikes that I have done or will do, and wanted them to be adorned on my backpack.",
          "Chamonix is a massive tourist town, and I hurried up and down the long stretch of shops and restaurants. I must have seen all that they had to offer, which is a lot.",
          "Two of the coolest people I met on the trip found me as I was speed walking around: Barak and Neta from Israel. It was great to see them one last time now that we were back in civilization.",
          "Finally I found my pin at a random shop at the end of the street. Satisfied with my purchase I returned to the bus stop in order to get back in time for dinner.",
          "The group that was staying there (from day one) had been at a bar the entire time and came to dinner very tipsy. It made for a very interesting meal: a carafe of wine was spilled during the course of it. We hung out in the common room after dinner, and then said goodnight.",
          "I left for the airport early in the morning, and looked out longingly at the mountains as the shuttle sped past them on the expressway.",
          "While this trek wasn’t as intense as the Camino, it was still special in its own way, along with its own challenges. I accomplished so many feats of strength that I had never had to worry about before, and it left me as a stronger person.",
          "I love Europe, and can’t wait to come back!"

      "Starting high in the Pyrenees mountains between France and Spain, and leading to the Atlantic ocean, the Camino Frances is part of a series of ancient routes that unfold across Europe called the Camino de Santiago: a network of pilgrimages leading to the city of Santiago de Compostela in northwestern Spain. I spent 32 days walking 534 miles over hills and mountains, across deserts, through rivers, and in thick forests.",
      "It's hard to capture 32 days worth of experiences in these snapshots, but hopefully they offer a picture of my journey on this adventure, and a glimpse into the time spent on this thru-hike."

          "The air was crisp and fresh, as all early summer mornings should be, as I tied my shoes, stood up, slung my backpack over my shoulders, and stepped out the front door.",
          "I'm standing on the Rue de la Citadelle in St-Jean-Pied-de-Port in shoes that aren't broken in, and a hat from Lollapalooza. It’s a cold brisk morning on June 2nd, 2018 and I’m about to start the Camino de Santiago.",
          "As I stood there in the early morning light on the street I tried to take stock of what I had come here to do, and what was about to happen. I stared down the road, watching other pilgrims march up the stone-paved road and off into the distance, before finally muttering to myself \"alright, let's go.\"",
          "To be honest, I really didn't know which way to go, so I blindly followed three pilgrims who were walking side-by-side further ahead of me. The sun was shining, and the clouds were few and far between, as we left the village behind and entered the countryside.",
          "Shortly after I cleared the final threshold of buildings that separated the man-made world from natural world, the three ladies whom I had been following suddenly stopped. As I was walking past them, now confident in the way to go, and I overheard one of them ask out loud \"Is this the right way?\" I offered the best advice that I could give: \"Yeah, I think so.\"",
          "And that's all it took. I came to France alone but this pilgrimage, which started barely 30 minutes ago, was no longer a solo trip, and I had made new friends. They were: Amy (USA), Martha (UK), and Tracey (AUS).",
          "We left the stone-paved village roads behind, gradually rising above the clouds with each step. Every time I turned around to stare in awe at the view in front of my eyes it seemed like I was becoming further separated from the world.",
          "Gradually our group splintered while we were walking and talking.",
          "After a while the topic of conversation turned to \"Why are you walking across Spain?\". I suddenly realized that I didn't know and my mind started to cloud with answers as I tried to formulate something. Hopefully I'll find an answer to that question as this adventure continues.",
          "Around mid-morning we arrived at Orisson. We were in desperate need of a break since none of us were prepared for how much constant uphill walking was involved. After resting and refueling on water we returned to the trail. The clouds had followed us, and we were treated to cool temperatures and fog-filled paths.",
          "Shortly thereafter the fog left us and we were back to staring at the curving paved road as we continued up the mountainside. Each time I saw a curve ahead of us, and the road disappeared behind it, I hoped that this must be the top.",
          "The marked way left the paved road behind shortly before reaching the border of Spain, near the top.",
          "Here the fog returned to us and clung to the trees, covering the path in the far distance. It would still be another hour of following the road up and around the mountain forest before we would come to a marker signifying that the way down had begun. After more than five hours of ascending, we were finally on the descent and in Spain.",
          "It took all of my concentration to stay vertical, and to keep my feet from getting stuck in the mud. The trees were dense here, and the air heavy. We nearly bushwhacked our way through the forest, loosing the trail and then finding it a few moments later each time.",
          "Shortly before exiting the woods, and entering Roncesvalles, I managed to slip and fall on my ass.",
          "I have never been happier to see a destination. It meant clean clothes, hot showers, and companionship with the people that you struggled all day with. The air was filled only with the sounds of birds chirping, pilgrims arriving and cleaning off their shoes, and the energy of conversation filling the dormitory halls.",
          "With our belly's full from a three course meal we said our goodbyes and retreated back to the monastery dorms. We found the others sitting at the entrance to our floor and spent the next hour talking, laughing, and getting to know each other.",
          "Tomorrow meant more downhill hiking as we would begin descending the Pyrenees and make our way for Zubiri. Hopefully the rains will stay away and keep the path dry for us."

          "The chirping of birds filled the dormitory room as I rolled onto my side and pushed myself up from the bottom of the bunk bed. After randomly shoving things into my bag I did one last check before heading downstairs.",
          "After grabbing what looked like edible (and hopefully healthy) food from the vending machine I retrieved my boots from the smelly storage room, placed my backpack on a bench in the inner courtyard, and took a step out the front door.",
          "Chilly morning air greeted me as I stood there in front of the rolling hills and mountains that we conquered yesterday. The world here was calm, and relaxed.",
          "The others had arrived downstairs when I returned to fetch my bag. With food in bags, shoes tied, and light jackets on, we set out.",
          "We (Amy and I) were forced to walk in the street due to the mud-filled paths leading away from the Monastery. The road took us through a small town a few kilometers away from Roncesvalles. We found our way down a small slope at the end of the village, and returned to the trail with trees on our left, and cows on our right. We tried talking to the horses but they weren't being very responsive.",
          "I stopped for a brief moment to turn around and take in the sunrise as it crested over the hills behind us. 30 minutes later we were heading into another quiet town. We took a short break at the only cafe that was open. The path took us back in to the trees, and up more hills. Our conversation returned to where it had left ended from the previous day. Music kept us company as we spent the next hour hiking through dense woods with open grass prairies appearing through breaks in the trees.",
          "This day was full of ups and downs and all of it was beautiful and breathtaking. Sometimes it is hard to enjoy the amazing world around you when you have to fight for every step. I wish I had taken it all in with more frequent stops.",
          "A small stream followed us along the concrete path as we descended. The stream eventually got louder and bigger until finally we were upon a river with its water rushing over the concrete. In order to cross this water we had to step along the tops of short concrete pillars that acted somewhat like a dam.",
          "On the other side of this river the path led up to a bar on the side of the road, and we didn't hesitate. 9:30 am on a Sunday was the perfect time for beer and wine when you're on the early days of the Camino.",
          "The terrain around us alternated between bare rock and dense trees. Eventually we came to a fork in the path, and the break in the trees gave us a perfect view of the tree-covered hills in the distance. Nothing but hills and trees as far as we could see with blue skies, and white clouds hovering near the horizon.",
          "At this point we had started on our way down towards Zubiri.",
          "The ground became unrelenting with the bedrock turned up at a 45 degree angle, and each edge of each protruding rock looking like a razor sharp knife. These parts were also covered with slippery mud.",
          "Up ahead on the other side of a curve in the highway was a small snack stand. It had a basket for women to donate their underwear, and the reward for your donation was a wish being granted to you that you would meet your future husband on this Camino. No underwear was donated, but we grabbed some food and relaxed. Familiar faces started to arrive at the rest stop as we grabbed a table in the shade.",
          "Our time here was short since we were eager to finish today's route. After another two hours of hiking, and nearly rolling my ankle a dozen times, we arrived in Zubiri.",
          "Upon entering the town over the bridged river, we got lost trying to find the place that we would hopefully be staying at. Eventually we found our way and grabbed some beds at the small and cozy municipal Albergue.",
          "The local cafe was called Estrella Galicia and we headed there to wait for the others to arrive. The clouds had begun to roll in, and shortly after it began to rain. Luckily our friends arrived just before the heavy rain started to fall. While we sheltered from the rain in the cafe we met some new friends.",
          "This night would be the first real night on the Camino: no longer would we be sheltered by modern conveniences. The walled fort-city that is famous for running with the bulls at Pamplona was waiting for us, and I was eager to begin the next days hike through more green hills."

          "A misty rain, and gray clouds, kept pace with us as we grabbed breakfast at the cafe from the previous night, took our final steps over the bridge that had brought us in to town, and headed for the hills.",
          "We briefly hiked passed industrial sites that invaded the green world around us.",
          "Fog, mist, and heavy gray clouds hugged the hills in the distance as we traded paved roads for gravel ones. Each stolen glance behind showed a town of white and red houses shrinking into the distance, become a multi-colored dot on the side of a hill.",
          "Nature quickly surrounded us as we left the gravel road, and took the narrow stone-paved path higher towards the light falling rain. Shortly soon-after we were made aware that we were in the Basque Country. Poppies lined the trail as we walked past barbed wire fences with donkeys staring in wonder at us, and a few of them posed for pictures.",
          "The large and fast moving Arga River was on our right as the sun came out. We approached our first stop at a cafe on the outskirts of Zuriáin, along the rivers edge.",
          "Over the next hour we walked along highways, passed abandoned buildings, and through tall grasses. Here we came to a fork in the path: off to the left led to Pamplona, and to the right was a small detour which led to Zabaldica at the top of a hill. I chose the detour, while the others chose the main route.",
          "The small hamlet at the top on this detour contained a 12-century church: Iglesia de San Esteban, which has one of the oldest church bells in Spain. I lit a candle, grabbed some photos from the bell tower, and continued on.",
          "While hiking down the dusty path from the church I happened upon a small snack stand sitting in the shade of an old farmhouse. I grabbed an apple and left a small donation.",
          "There were no other pilgrims walking ahead of, or behind, me as I headed over random hillside paths, through dark tunnels under highways, and down sloping tree-lined roads towards a bridge that led to Trinidad de Arre.",
          "I quickened my pace after realizing that I had not seen my new Camino friends, and hoping that I would find them up ahead of me. After walking through the empty city streets I spotted them resting at a cafe in a small town square.",
          "The final route to Pamplona took us through some of the busiest, and shadiest, parts of the city. I can't imagine what it must be like to live here and to see so many pilgrims backpacking along your streets.",
          "Empty urban streets gave way to a small park which led to the Magdalena Bridge, and the walled city. Ahead of me stood some of the most massive stone walls that I have ever seen. It took us 10 minutes to make our way around the base of these walls and arrive at the drawbridge entrance.",
          "After crossing the drawbridge we turned the corner and were met with some of the most colorful buildings. Every single building was a different color alternating between pink, blue, green, or yellow. There were town fountains everywhere, and the young people hung out in the streets drinking.",
          "We dropped our stuff off at a nice Albergue because the previous night at Zubiri was too much of a shock, and it was the first one we came across. There was a bar down the street called Meson de la Navarreria, and we saddled up there for food and drinks.",
          "I left the bar to check out the church, and ran into Tania from Roncesvalles taking a tour of the city with one of her Camino friends: Alex (USA). We headed to the ramparts which look out over the new construction beyond the walls. The church was empty and dark; not ready for tourists just yet, but eventually I would return later on and check it out. The main square was full of activity with people dining and kids running about.",
          "The hills, while beautiful, were starting to get to me with all of the descending and I was ready for some flat ground. The day after tomorrow promised that: we would be leaving for the monument to the pilgrims at Alto de Perdon, and the city of Puente la Reina."

          "It didn't take me long to find a route leading way away from the square, and towards the other areas of the city. While the square in the morning was calm and peaceful, the area outside of the urban center were bustling with activity.",
          "There wasn't much to see beyond the architecture of the buildings, and the various parks. You couldn't even get inside the arena where the release the bulls. Slightly disappointed, I hurried back to the Albergue.",
          "Leaving the city took less time than entering it. The residents were starting to stir, and the street cleaners were mopping up the mess from the previous night.",
          "After zigzagging through a series of small and large parks we found ourselves once again walking through the countryside of Spain with the city growing smaller and smaller with each glance backwards.",
          "Nothing but green fields were laid out in front of us, with clouds sticking to the ground, their fingers clawing at the hills in the distance trying to pull themselves closer to the earth.",
          "Rainbows appeared at every edge of a leading cloud formation. Luckily the rain stayed away from us, and their dark gray color was merely for show.",
          "Large and narrow gravel paths filled with potholes of water snaked their way across the fields, through small forests, and over small rivers. Gradually The Way began to rise higher and higher leading towards Zariquiegui: the last stop before crossing over Alto de Perdon, and the windy mountain crossing.",
          "I caught up with Tania's group (Shelby, Alex, and Tania) in Zariquiegui. They were getting ready to head out as I arrived. Jokingly I said that I'd see them at the next rest stop since that was where we kept running into each other. The other friends from my group slowly trickled in and dropped their bags at the cafe.",
          "After recharging we slowly left for the top of the mountain. On the way up we kept leap frogging each other when those in front slowed down, or took pictures, and the others from behind kept going.",
          "The views from the top did not disappoint, and it was the windiest spot so far on the Camino with views of the countryside extending away in all directions.",
          "The way down though was hard, and slow going.",
          "After reaching flat ground again, I suddenly found myself very much alone. I don’t know how it started, but I was talking to myself. To be perfectly honest with you, I have never done anything like this before. All sorts of random things started popping into my brain, and coming out of my mouth.",
          "I stopped paying attention to the ground I was walking on, or to the world around me. I just walked and talked, walked and talked.",
          "Everything from the real reason why I’m here doing the Camino, why I do the things I do, realizing that I hated my job, what brought me happiness, and what left me empty and wanting more.",
          "It was an amazing feeling to shine light onto things that were hiding in the shadows, and things that I didn’t even know I was thinking. I felt so great about airing out my thoughts and feelings.",
          "At some point I met up with the others in the outskirts of Urtega. We grabbed lunch at a small Albergue in town for about an hour, and relaxed in the sun.",
          "After leaving Urtega we spread out again as we walked through Obanos on our way to Puente la Reina.",
          "An attractive looking Albergue at the edge of town as we got off of the Camino beckoned to us. It took some debating, but we ended up staying at Albergue Reparadores further in to town. It is one of the oldest Albergues on the Camino (hundreds of years). Some of us from our group cooked a dinner, and the others shared what they had to give.",
          "Overall this wasn’t a bad day in terms of terrain or distance, but this was the first time that I had done any sort of back-to-back, day-in-day-out, walking and my feet were feeling it. Hopefully tomorrow will be flat ground on the way to Estella."

          "The storks nesting in the bell tower of the church next to the albergue were still sleeping when the sun rose and covered the city in a warm glow. I set out earlier than the others to take a short meandering walk through the narrow stone streets of the old city. They took me to the east end of the queen's bridge that led out of town.",
          "The green-covered hills on the far side stood in contrast to the stone-made world behind me. I turned around after crossing the bridge and took in its beauty.",
          "Some familiar faces called out my name and pulled me back from the trance that the bridge was holding over me. Tania, Shelby, and Alex were just coming across the bridge and heading out. I asked if I could join them on todays walk. They would become my new Camino companions for the next several days.",
          "Autumn-colored fields and hills greeted us as soon as we left the bridge behind. However relatively flat ground was once again laid out as far as the eye could see after crossing the highway that separated the last of the colorful hills from the village beyond.",
          "After a short detour through this village the landscape was full of mostly gently rolling fields of grain, small hills, and patchworks of small farms. A low stone wall bordered the trail on the right as it snaked its way past groves of trees.",
          "Breakfast was in a city called Cirauqui on a hill that rose up from the ground in the distance. It felt medieval with walls at the base, and roads that went in all different directions as they worked their way up from the flat ground to the top.",
          "Poppy fields and a rest spot with a reading area welcomed us as we left the hilltop city behind.",
          "We continued alongside a highway for most of the morning while going under bridges, down into small valleys, and passing a cat on a fence trying to find its way down. An hour later we passed under a stone bridge crossing and made our way into Villatuerta.",
          "At the Plaza Mayor we let our feet rest, and waited for those who were behind us. Once the others arrived, and our bellies had some food in them, we left for our destination and place of rest for the night.",
          "A mountain in the distance kept its watchful eye on us as we left town and walked out into empty fields. We took the long way around a lonely small church standing in the middle of these fields as the dirt path slowly resolved into the road to Estella.",
          "On the outskirts of the city was a massive half-ruined church. I stuck my phone through the metal gate on the side in order to photograph the smoothly rounded pillars as they stood in the tall grasses that now covered what was once the interior of this old building.",
          "I rejoined the others near a map of the town on the other side of the road. It was here that we needed to make a choice since we had arrived so early: either keep going until we got tired and found a town to stop at, or stay here in Estella. We decided to keep going, but the Albergue looked less than welcoming so we turned back.",
          "We went to the old city, which was hidden behind a stone wall and tightly packed houses. It was much quieter here, away from the hustle and bustle of the fast moving world several hundred feet away. Our beds were on the second floor looking out over the street through balcony doors.",
          "Once we had settled in, we went to the bar across the street to snack and drink. Because today was a mostly easy one, we had arrived quite early in the afternoon, and retreated to our beds shortly afterwards. Down in the streets below someone was playing the Spanish guitar as we fell asleep for an afternoon nap.",
          "The bar across the street was still open when we woke up. We played card games (Shelby taught us Yanev), drank some calimochos, and relaxed by the waters edge. Afterwards we found a pizza place for a quick meal. Today was a mostly uneventful day, and I can't wait for walks through rolling fields and clear blue skies. Hopefully we get to experience these things tomorrow as we make for Los Arcos."

          "Another calm and peaceful morning on the Camino. We retraced our steps from the previous day as we took an early leave out of town. Another cloudy morning kept us company.",
          "With the Ega river at our backs we marched along dirt paths hugging vine-covered stone walls. A fork in the road forced a decision upon us: go left for a shorter hike, or go right for a longer hike. \"To the right,\" we said. The wine fountain was to be found that way in Irache, and find it we did.",
          "Free red wine flowed from a spout in the side of a winery and we indulged ourselves. Odd thing: the winery was on the other side of the road from a monastery. But who could ask for more at 7:30 in the morning? With the edges of our lips stained purple we returned to the dirt path and continued our march towards Monjardin.",
          "In and out of forests we went, up and down, with the humidity rising along with us. The pyramid-shaped mountain growing larger with each step we took.",
          "From the tops of the hills we glanced out over the countryside to our right, seeing nothing but an ocean of various greens on the ground, spotted with red roofs, and the blue sky trying to find its way through the blanket of gray above us.",
          "The rain finally started to fall as a light drizzle, sprinkling us with a refreshing cool shower after our short break in Azqueta.",
          "The only shelter from the steadily increasing rainfall was a medieval water fountain at the base of Villamayor de Monjardin, and we arrived just in time. Its stone steps led down from the street above towards the water pool below. We filled up on water in the town square and headed for the next section which had no water or shade for 12 kilometers.",
          "After an hour of rough and muddy paths we broke free from the hill's hold on the ground beneath our feet, and suddenly burst forth into green and yellow fields. The ever present blanket of gray clouds soon began to disperse, and the blue sun-filled sky brightened the beautiful landscape around us.",
          "The drying dirt path split the land down the middle with the green world to the left, and the yellow one to our right. A relaxing food stand playing Mexican music appeared in the distance. It was time to begin the long stretch of no breaks.",
          "With the modern world behind us we headed for Los Arcos.",
          "It was here that I decided to listen to some music while I walked in order to avoid going crazy from the steady march of one foot in the front of the other.",
          "Songs that I had downloaded a week ago were waiting for me as I popped in the headphones. I zoned out for the first half of the playlist and not really paying attention. But then, in the middle of the set, a song came on that grabbed me: \"Maps\" by Handsome Ghost. I can't say why this one song, out of all the others, grabbed my attention. I focused more on the music and less on my feet doing their steady drumbeat upon the Earth.",
          "The next song in the queue really did me in: \"Full Release\" by Little Monarch. These lyrics spoke to me while I walked in that world of rolling green fields, blue and white sky, and the string of marching pilgrims. I started doing a little dance as I passed one irrigation canal after another, not caring how much further we had to go, but instead caring more about being in this moment.",
          "Here is the list of songs that I saved and nearly immediately started listening to on repeat: \"Maps\" by Handsome Ghost, \"Full Release\" by Little Monarch, \"Love Teach Me (Orchestral Version)\" by Benjamin James, \"Kings & Queens(Acoustic)\" by Mat Kearney, \"Dancing in the Street\" by Stephen Day, \"Horses\" by Yes Nice.",
          "But we were marching relentlessly forward, and this moment was coming to an end.",
          "Dusty dirt paths, spared from the rain earlier in the morning, wound their way towards the edge of the forest, and down towards low-lying pools of water.",
          "We arrived in Los Arcos at the edge of the village, next to a bunch of farms. We decided to not stay at the Albergue next to a smelly farm, and kept going towards Torres del Rio.",
          "Keep in mind that these are the early days of the camino, and we haven't fully figured out the traditional layout of old Spanish cities.",
          "The farms, and the talkative animals, gave way to the more civilized portion of the city with clean stone streets and its beautiful church taking up the town square. Hordes of pilgrims were here enjoying lunch at the numerous shaded tables. Were we wrong, yes, but did that change our mind, no. It was early in the day, and we felt like we could handle another 8 kilometers to Torres del Rio.",
          "We never made it to Torres, and only 75% of us made it to the next town at Sansol. Torres del Rio was only a half kilometer further down the hill we had just hiked up to get here, and even though it was close by, we collectively agreed to push no further. That final stretch along featureless gravel paths gave our minds, and our feet, the final knockout blow.",
          "But it turned out to be a small cute village with a Moroccan themed Albergue with fantastic views of the countryside, and a delicious dinner of Tajine.",
          "They had an ice cold pool of water in the courtyard, and we stuck our feet in as soon as we got settled. After the initial shock wore off, it was pure bliss.",
          "Finally, blue skies and rolling fields, exactly what I had been hoping for since day one! Logrono is tomorrow and I'm beginning to not look forward to staying in large cities. Hopefully it's another flat day of walking."

          "Morning's gentle breeze fluttered through the open windows, tossing the thin laced drapes about in its wake allowing the light in without any resistance. And what a sunrise it was. Bright burning reds, soft glowing pinks, and warm expanding yellows filled the sky outside our windows and rested upon the fields beneath it. I can't recall ever seeing such a beautiful sight of nature so early in the morning.",
          "I stole a look back at Monjardin from across the fields as we headed up the hill and out of Torres del Rio. For the first time on this trip I had the ability to measure the distance travelled from the previous day, and it was humbling.",
          "Decorative cairns stacked in the most unbelievable formations lay on either side of our path through the hills. Several trees also had decorations hanging from them, mostly colorful ribbons. Each one a donation, or a sign of respect, for someone or something.",
          "As we left the cairns behind and entered the farmland old stone benches and abandoned farm houses appeared every so often. Most of the buildings that were built into the hill side (which still had roofs) had been destroyed by other pilgrims using them for a quick relief.",
          "Several steep ascents and descents crept up out of no where as we left one farming area for another. One of our French traveling companions showed us how to walk downhill \"like a monkey\" in order to keep the strain off of our knees. It looked funny and felt awkward, but worked!",
          "Viana stood in the distance as we returned to the highway shoulder. Some cars honked in encouragement, and others gave us cold stares.",
          "We did some window shopping as we walked toward the church for our break. I bought a new full-brimmed hat because my Lollapalooza one just wasn't cutting it: one burned neck too many.",
          "The church, what was left of it, was beautiful on the inside despite the unassuming wooden door at its entrance. Adjacent to the church stood what is now an open-air courtyard, but in historic times was another interior section of the church. A fire had ripped through in the 13th century, nearly destroying the lot of it.",
          "Our time here was brief, and we took what appeared to be the back alleys out from the city and once more into the countryside. I am beginning to feel at home walking on these dirt paths through fields and grasses and trees. The times we spend in large cities feel foreign.",
          "Arrows and messages made of pebbles to friends from pilgrimages long ago dot the sides of the trail as we walk towards Logrono.",
          "Wooden steps take us over the highway. I stare back at Viana, now so small, in the distance. Another reminder of how far I've gone, and how far I have to go.",
          "Rain, our friend for so many of these days, decided to pay us another visit. Here the path turned back to pavement made of concrete and asphalt. Several caterpillars are racing from one side of the path to another, desparate to get somewhere, and to avoid being trampled. I took my steps with care in order to avoid them.",
          "Signs told us we had left the Navarre region and were now in La Rioja, an area known for their red wine.",
          "We walked along the Ebro river, through the various city parks, the ground shining from the freshly fallen rain.",
          "Up ahead is the Puente de Piedra our way into the city, and one final set of stairs, before we can find a place to rest.",
          "The city streets leading us through the old town are nearly empty, most people inside back at work. We walked all the way to the tourist center at the other end of the town to get a map. The Camino was not well marked inside the city, and we did not have a guidebook with us. We found a few places to try near the Municipal Albergue, and started with that one.",
          "They had beds, but for whatever reason they demanded to keep our passports while we stayed there. None of us felt comfortable with that, so we headed back down the street towards a place near the edge of the old town and, being satisfied with the price for a bed and dinner, decided to call it home for the night. It was a good choice.",
          "Logrono is a beautiful city with its streets artfully decorated, and the massive church at its center commanding attention with each ring of the bells. We found Martha, Amy, and Tracey relaxing with everyone we had met so far on the Camino in the main square watching the townspeople set up for a festival this evening (please let it not be loud).",
          "Ok, so Logrono wasn't that bad of a big city, but honestly I'm looking forward to Najera tomorrow and the smaller city scene. My small Lolla hat was beginning to show its limits with sun protection. I might need to look into buying a real sun hat."

          "Today started with empty stomachs. Our expectation that a cafe would always be open early in the morning for food was slowly becoming unreliable. Logrono left us high and hungry as we took our leave of the city.",
          "On unsteady legs we walked through the city parks along the bike path. Every store or cafe in the distance was a chance for food, but none were open. Not even the supermarket at the end of the trail seemed alive. The underpass and open country ahead signaled a goodbye to any hope of finding food before the next city 13 kilometers away.",
          "The sky was a deep blue, and the clouds were a mixture of soft gray and white. Tall trees and poppy fields stole the attention away from food, but not for long. A large park was fast approaching, and scouts were sent in each direction to find food but they came back empty handed each time.",
          "Uphill, around a bend, and then a sight that will make you stop in your tracks: a shimmering lake surrounded by dark hills, still hidden from the sun, with that deep blue sky above it. Seeing such a beautiful thing so early in the morning clears your mind.",
          "Just up ahead, at the corner of the lake, stood another seemingly empty park and we had to steal our eyes away from the lake as we returned to the trees.",
          "But ahead there were signs for food. A cafe on the waters edge? An open cafe? A place with bathrooms, water, and food! We dropped our packs and got in line as the owner was opening up.",

          "Full stomachs, warmed hearts, and blood caffeinated. We're ready for the day now.",
          "An hour later we came across an old man selling his wares, and handing out stamps. His name was Marcelo Lobato, and we found out that he is a walking legend. This man has walked nearly 5,000 miles across Europe.",

          "An old pilgrim hospital lay in ruins as we took the road towards the hill. We weaved our way through the streets, heading for the church and our next break. These people spared no expense when they built these churches several hundred years ago. The alter was covered in gold with several dozen saints and idols in it. I don't think I'll ever tire of these amazing structures built so long ago.",
          "We left for what would become the longest chunk of walking yet at nearly 16 km. Most of the landscape was farms, with the usual ups and downs, and nothing to stare at but the land in the distance and watching those white downs on the horizon grow into white mounds, and those white mounds to grow into buildings.",
          "In Ventosa we decided as a group to not stop, and instead to push for Nájera in order to knock it out all at once.",
          "More unending farmland with the occasional pocket of trees. After Ventosa all we could see in the distance were two white mounds that were slowly growing, but yet were still so far away. It's hard to gauge how far away an object is sometimes.",
          "The brown dirt path took us next to highways, through small towns, and passed industrial sites.",
          "And that was when it happened, on the last hill before heading down into Nájera. Everything from my hips to my feet were in pain. I was struggling to take each step, and my feet just wanted to quit.",
          "I had been listening to music for a while now to help me get through these long kilometers. Upon arrival at the summit overlooking the last leg of the journey today, the song Believer by American Authors started playing.",
          "“I’m a believer that things will get better”.",
          "These lyrics started to play as soon as I hit the summit and saw our destination in the distance. It hit me like a ton of bricks.",
          "The pain will get better, the stress will get better, the hardship of walking will get better, the beauty of this land will get better, and the struggles in life will get better.",
          "All of this hit me at once, and it was an overwhelming feeling. I winced with pain, nearly crying at points, as Tania and I entered the city of Nájera. We had become separated from the others during the last stretch.",
          "We walked for what seemed like ages to find a place to stay. After following a group of Spaniards we eventually arrived at Las Pena near the edge of the city. I could give two shits about the place, it was a bed and a shower.",
          "The rivers edge and the bright sun called to us. We headed there for lunch and drinks. After basking in the sun, and spilling wine on my pants, we returned to our beds for a much needed nap. I spotted Leon and the others coming up the river walk and heading to the grocery store across the bridge when I went back to town a short while later. I followed them and finally got smart about getting some snacks for the next days walk.",
          "They bought a bottle of wine and some chocolates. We returned to the rivers edge and sat in the grass sharing the bottle.",

          "Water running through pipes and canals kept the trail company as the farmed vegetation continuously changed from small green plants to larger bushes, and back. The beautifully evil poppies exploded in abundance on one side, while the other was carefully maintained to keep those pesky invaders away.",
          "The sun was relentless today, and before long my shirt was nearly soaked through. Azofra was the first town for a rest that morning, but I was in such a good mood and had a good speed going so I kept going. Might have been a mistake.",
          "Shortly after Azofra the farms faded away as the trail took a sharp turn towards the highway, and then a left turn as it returned to pure countryside. After that there were no detours off of the path, and no rest stops, for the next 13 kilometers to Cirueña.",
          "My attention, however, was not on the hot sun, or the stretch ahead that had no places to take a break. Instead, it was fixed on the endless green fields in front of me. The gravel path that marked The Way shot like a bullet across its surface, splitting the green world in two.",
          "Islands of trees dotted the tops of hills on the horizon with lines made from tractor tires heading straight for them. Wisps of white clouds stretched themselves thin across the dark blue sky. Small clumps of puffy clouds swept their shadows across the perfectly bright green fields.",
          "Luckily there was a rest stop ahead at the top of a steep hill. It had benches, reclining sun chairs, and little statues. A perfect place to enjoy my snacks in the shade and to let my back take a breather.",
          "The ghost town of Cirueña wasn't that much further.",
          "A golf course on the left greeted the Pilgrims, along with some odd looking statues and sculptures of the pilgrimage. But this golf course had bathrooms, and I was in dire need of one. On my way out I ran into Tania. We chilled for a few minutes before picking up where we both left off and got back on the marked sidewalk taking us through empty housing developments and back out to the green pastures.",
          "Santo Domingo slowly rose from the ground in the distance as the dark gray clouds marched over the hills to the South. Our focus was now getting there before it rained. A herd of sheep followed along side us as we walked into town. The Albergue here, the only one really, was massive but had good amenities.",
          "The rain started to fall as I checked in to my home for the night. It was Sunday, and many of the bars/restaurants were closed for the afternoon. We did our usual routine of shower + laundry + nap.",
          "I noticed back in Logrono that my flip-flops which I used for showering were not up to the additional task of walking around town at the end of the day. I found a hiking gear store next door and popped in. They were selling hiking sandals, and I didn't waste much time in deciding to invest in a pair. My feet felt like they were walking on air, and the sides of my feet were no longer being torn into by thin straps.",
          "Happy with my purchase I put them to use by walking around town to get some cash, and to check out the church. As I got back to the Albergue the others were beginning to arrive, soaked from the rain.",
          "After sitting around for a while at the Albergue (again, nothing open because Sunday), Leon and I decided to take a walk and explore the city. We ended up talking and walking for nearly two hours about work, philosophy (his current major in college), and where we wanted to take our futures. Our journey took us to the edge of town, and down along their main street and past fancy restaurants.",
          "For dinner I found a bar that sold real eggs. You have no idea how amazing the simplest of foods can taste when you’re forced to forgo them because of weight and your hierarchy of needs while backpacking.",
          "I’m amazed that today was only 20km, but that it felt easy, and I only stopped for 10-15 minutes in total today. Tomorrow should be another short day, but the rain did not look like it was going to stay away for long."

          "A wall of water was coming. I left Santo Domingo de la Calzada at seven in the morning, alone. And honestly, I can't remember why. Maybe I was anxious to begin, maybe the others were sleeping in, or maybe I looked at the weather forecast and saw the heavy rain in the afternoon.",
          "Today's stage was meant to be a short one, and I could have easily slept in. The sun was already up and hiding behind the clouds as I walked out of the city and into the fields.",
          "Green farm fields, similar to the scenery from the first half of yesterdays walk, surrounded me so I kept my head down and focused on the steps, trying to ignore the pain in my feet. I'm still secretly hoping that the problem with my knee will get better on its own.",
          "I passed through Granon without stopping, and continued on to Redecilla del Camino. Without even realizing it, I had passed out of Basque territory and into the Castilla y Leon region. This would end up being the widest region on the Camino.",
          "After filling up on water, and taking a quick break, I went back out on to trail. The next town was Castildelgato, and the only thing that caught my eye there was an old gate, standing guard over a field of grass. I wonder what used to be there, oh so long ago, and what that gate protected.",
          "Viloria de Rioja was the next town after Castildelgato. A pilgrim whom I had seen in Santo carrying a MacBook (of all things) with them was just up ahead, and we chatted for a little bit as we arrived at Viloria. They were using a porter service so they only had to walk with a backpack during the day, hence why they were able to carry something weighing a few pounds.",
          "We stopped at the open Albergue in town, and they were serving breakfast. I was tempted to buy an omelette, but the place gave me a weird vibe, so I used the facilities and kept going. The other pilgrim stayed behind and hung out for a little bit, but I was in one of my \"gotta get there gotta get going\" moods.",
          "But I was happy with my decision because as soon as I took the paved road out of town, the blue sky returned along with green hills and fields in the distance. They cultivated the entire surface of these hills, going all the way to the top. It made me nearly miss a step: another view of nothing but green fields and blue skies. I am loving this Camino, even with all of the pain that it brings.",
          "I stole myself away from the surrounding landscape, and thirty minutes later I was arriving in Villamayor del Rio. I pulled out some peanuts that I had picked up in Santo that morning and, having spotted the darkening clouds ahead of me, took out the rain jacket and bag cover. I decided to forego the poncho, and I would come to regret that decision. I stuffed the peanuts in my pocket, threw on the backpack, and hit the road.",
          "Not a minute had gone by before the first raindrop fell on me. I was so proud of my decision to put on the rain gear. This weather wasn't going to catch me off guard. I snapped some pictures of the trail before putting my phone away and getting ready to go into heads down mode. That was the last picture I would take on todays walk.",
          "I smelled the rain before I saw it. I could hear the whooshing sound as it raced over the ground, disturbing the air ahead of it. Those first few raindrops were an early warning, and I did not listen to them.",
          "It had begun to rain, and I mean really rain. Straight up downpour. It rained a whole heck of a lot harder than I thought it would, and my entire lower half got soaked. The rain even started to penetrate my rain coat! Luckily the stuff in my bag stayed dry.",
          "With heavy wet shoes I entered Belorado an hour later, probably carrying enough rain water to fill a small bottle.",
          "The Municipal Albergue wasn't open yet when I arrived (after all, it was only 11:30 am), so I hung out with the other rain soaked Pilgrims as we waited for them to finish cleaning.",
          "Now that the rain was done, I set out to explore the village in order to kill some time before dinner. My exploring was short lived because I was starving. I grabbed lunch at a small restaurant above a bar in the town square that apparently hated natural light (there weren't any windows). The Paella and wine were really good though, and they had the world cup on the TV.",
          "I headed back to the Albergue after getting some supplies to take a nap, and saw that I had a bunk mate, and that they were using my outlet extension cord! Her name was Crissi (USA). I was so happy that someone was actually able to use it, and she commended me on the genius of bringing it.",
          "After waking up I still had more time to kill before dinner. Damn these early arrival times! I went back out to do more exploring, and ran into Crissi near a ruined church. We checked out the church, walked around, and hiked up to the castle ruins at the top of a hill next to town.",
          "I loved the view of the city from up here, and took out my phone to take a picture. As I took a step forward to get the shot, I nearly slipped off the side of the hill! That would have been a bad way to end the Camino.",
          "We ended up ordering dinner at the Albergue (the food was delicious), and met a lot of great people. Two of them were from Texas: Lauren and Hailey. They quickly became known as \"The Texans\".",
          "This day started out with my head focused on the ground, alone, and soaking wet, but ended with new friends and great conversation. And I was looking forward to walking with them the next day. The destination is 30 kilometers away called Ages (pronounced ah-guess, kind of like August), and tomorrows forecast had zero rain in the afternoon."

          "The stirring of other pilgrims kept me awake for most of the night, and woke me early in the morning. Both of the neighboring bunk beds were already empty when I finally got up at 6am. I hopped down from the bed, and saw that Crissi had also left for the day. She must left very early in the morning with the first wave of pilgrims. I was bummed out that I didn't get a chance to say goodbye.",
          "My shoes were still soaked with water as I took out all of the newspaper that I had stuffed in there yesterday. I had made plans last night to meet up with Tania and Shelby in the morning so, with no one to wait on nor to wait on me, I saddled up the bag, put on my shoes, and headed their way. The other half of the group (Amy, Martha, Dom, Luigi, and Leon) had stayed at the first Albergue outside of town.",
          "I met up with Tania, Shelby, and a new pilgrim named Steve (USA) just as they were finishing up breakfast, and by 7am we were on the way to Agés.",
          "A constant light drizzle of rain decided to hang out with us as we headed towards Tosantos. Steve didn't have a rain coat, so they improvised one from some gas station garbage bags for him. Nothing quite like being warm and dry in the rain!",
          "After Tosantos the others needed to rest. I decided to pull ahead of everyone else in order to keep going, and told them I'd see them at the stage ender.",
          "The rains from yesterday had left numerous water-filled landmines, and the clouds threatened to unload more rain upon me as I passed through Villambistia and Espinosa del Camino. There were tons of fountains, but no places for food. Luckily I had the rain-soaked peanuts still in my coat pocket from yesterday. But as soon as I took them out and had a few, I threw them away. They tasted nasty.",
          "The views were very similar to yesterday, and the constant drizzle made it an unpleasant and boring walk. I arrived in Villafranca Montes de Oca (which was once a Roman city named Auca) and saw a truck-stop style diner. Food! I threw down my gear outside, and rushed in before the other pilgrims behind me could arrive. Needless to say, I was starving. The sandwiches here were massive! I could only finish half of mine, but now had lunch for later. I really need to get better at this thing called \"planning ahead\".",
          "With a full stomach I returned to the trail. The way out of town took me up above the church and through a steep and muddy mess. It was a lonely uphill walk through the mud-soaked woods. Few pilgrims were ahead or behind me.",
          "Up and down it went. Through forests, across rivers, past momuments, and onto super wide mud paths. It was here that a local trail angle had carved out a nice spot for herself and her dogs just before San Juan de Ortega. The puppers were chasing each other through the woods, and watching them warmed me up as I ate my snacks on a tree stump.",
          "The monastery at San Juan in the next town offered some amazing damp wood smells that you can only find in old buildings. This place had a barebones Albergue for pilgrims without any amenities, and while the thought tickled my brain for a brief moment, I wanted to push further.",
          "One beer later, and after eating the rest of my breakfast sandwich at a bar next to the monastery, I was back to slugging it through the woods towards Agés. I was grateful that most of the trail today was on soft earthen ground and not that nasty hard pavement.",
          "I emerged from the woods and saw a tree standing like a solitary guard, protecting the town behind it, with a yellow arrow painted across its trunk. It was like something out of a fairytale, and as soon as I took a picture of it a fast wind picked up and the clouds began to break apart.",
          "What I saw stretched out ahead of me made my jaw drop, literally. I had never seen such a wonderful view. Sure, Los Arcos was a beautiful walk, but I had no idea that it was just one of many amazing places on The Way.",
          "Remember how I said I could see myself living in Pamplona, well…if nearly every Spanish village was going to be surrounded by fields like this, it was going to be hard to choose one.",
          "I sat outside in the warm sun, letting the breeze dry my laundry, snacking on my chocolate as Tania, Shelby, and Steve arrived.",
          "In the hills behind the village there was an excavation site for pre-historic animals, and humans, at Atapuerca. For five euros a local bus picked us up from the town fountain and took us to the museum built near the site. From there another one took us up to the actual dig.",
          "They apparently found this cave by accident on the Matagrande Plain, so it’s not hard to imagine how many hidden gems are beneath your feet at this very moment. Steve (who is a Spanish teacher back in the states) translated everything that the guide told us about the areas history and how ancient humans had used the cave, how they had found it, and the things that they excavated.",
          "I will say this though: as fun as that was, it felt weird riding on a bus on the way back as we passed fellow pilgrims walking on the road. As if being in a motorized vehicle was wrong.",
          "All-in-all it was a great day filled with good walking, good weather, picture perfect scenery, and enjoying a home-cooked meal from the hospitalarios. Some of us even got a little (ok a lot) drunk on the wine, and they were hilarious at dinner. Tomorrow was the next big city on our trek: Burgos. It was also possibly the last time that I would be seeing all of the people that I had met so far."

          "I think a rooster woke me up. The wind had free rein as it whipped and wrapped itself around us on the exposed country road. It's a good thing they served us breakfast at our Albergue, or else the hunger would have helped the wind cut even deeper. Speaking of breakfasts, this was my first homemade breakfast on the Camino. It was a simple serving of eggs and toast, but it was filling. I miss having eggs for breakfast.",
          "Once again we were arriving in the town of Atapuerca, but this time it was by foot.",
          "At the first cafe we shamelessly helped ourselves to a small second breakfast. A \"small\" hill greeted us as soon as we left the town. This was the same hill that they were doing their excavations on, and part of it was fenced off. So much for exploring.",
          "We made it up the hill in no time at all.",
          "A tall wooden cross stood at the top, staring out at the rolling land from which we had come. On the ground behind it lay a large stone arrow pointing us in the direction of Burgos off in the distance. But the structures and decorations didn't stop there.",
          "Laid out on the ground ahead of us sat a weird series of concentric circles with a single way in and out. As we watched people walking along the spiraling rings, Shelby recognized what it was: a silent spiral maze.",
          "Each of us took turns walking (sometimes jogging) towards the center where a small wooden cross stood. It probably took 20 minutes to do the whole thing, and it was such a calming experience. It’s the simples things sometimes.",
          "However, it was time to return to reality. Burgos was waiting for us down the steep descent, and 17 kilometers away.",
          "It was an intense walk. There was a very long stretch (nearly 14 km) without any stops. But, that doesn't mean it wasn’t pretty.",
          "Through various villages we marched, finding rest stops along the way. As we began to enter the outer edges of the city, we took the route less traveled towards the river entrance. It took us pass a small airport and towards the factories on the cities limits.",
          "As we came to the highway leading in, we couldn’t find a way across. After trying to follow an ever-diminishing gravel path, we decided to bushwhack the shit out of it. We found what could barely be described as an “underpass”. It was a small gap under the highway with a clearance of 3 feet and went over a dry riverbed. The thorns and prickly grasses on the other side wanted us to stay out, but we pushed through it.",
          "It’s a good thing that we crossed when we did, because shortly thereafter all of the disgusting factory smells began to invade our space. Luckily we didn’t have to walk through the noxious fumes for very long, for we had arrived at the river, and we needed a break.",
          "Bread, chocolate, and cheeses were placed in front of each other as we made a little spot for ourselves next to a bench under the trees. We saw familiar faces pass by as we gorged on our delicious buffet.",
          "The riverwalk ahead took us straight into the historic part of Burgos (it was longer than we thought), and it took us nearly 30 minutes to walk the length of it before entering the city proper. But we did stray a bit away from the marked path because we decided to class it up and stay at an actual hostel (Hostel Burgos) with a private room for the four of us (Shelby, Tania, Philip, and myself). It was the first night that I didn’t have to wear earplugs. Thank you friends for not snoring!",
          "After the usual requirements of laundry and showering, my first stop was the cathedral. To be honest, it’s a beautiful building on the outside, and the interior is nice, but it’s set up like a museum which ruins the effect, for me at least. I had to speed through the tour anyways (at a cost of five euros) because Steve told me about the MEH (Museum of Human Evolution). I love learning about this stuff, and the experience from the dig tour from yesterday was still fresh in my mind.",
          "I ran over to the MEH (Museum of Human Evolution) to meet up with Steve and Shelby. They had a lot of information in there. I had seen most of it before, but the nerd in me always likes to geek out on this kind of stuff. Plus, it was free!",
          "Tania and Philip were waiting for us back at the hostel, and we all headed out to find a bar for the evening. As we entered the town square Amy, Martha, Luigi, Dom, and Leon showed up! They said they would find us later after walking around for a bit.",
          "We found a place that served tapas which each drink you ordered, it was great. Amy and the others showed up as we grabbed some tables and commenced indulging ourselves. Several rounds of beer were purchased throughout the night.",
          "They all got to chatting, and the idea of taking a relaxing day off tomorrow gained steam. I would have joined them, but I couldn’t afford to take any days off in order to finish in time. None of them had booked return flights, so they had some flexibility.",
          "But eventually the time came to say goodbye...",
          "I've walked nearly 300 kilometers for two weeks with most of them, and it was hard. You make such a profound impact on each other and it becomes too much when you start to think about not seeing them again, especially after all that you've been through on this pilgrimage. Each one of them left a mark on me, and helped make an impact on the Camino.",
          "I pushed the thought of not seeing these people again out of my head in order to get some sleep. Tomorrow was going to be brand new, but at the same time familiar. Hontanas is 30 kilometers, and a world of unknown, away from here."

          "Everyone was still sleeping when I woke up. After one last check in the locker I rolled up my sleeping liner and headed to the cafeteria to see what they had for breakfast. All they had was cold food consisting of cereal and toast, which was fitting for my current mood. I sat alone at a long table with my bag next to me, trying to eat as much as I could.",
          "Shit! I realized I had forgotten my towel. It was probably hanging off the end of the bed back in the room. Luckily Tania was awake and answered the door after a few soft taps. I gave her another firm hug before saying goodbye for good. This was getting real now.",
          "I took the stairs down to the street below, and stepped out into the cold air. The city was slowly waking up.",
          "At this moment I realized that I had no idea how to get out of the city. Everyone that I had been walking with so far had the guidebook, or knew enough Spanish to ask for help. It also didn't help that we stayed at a place off of the main path, far from any markers. Then I remembered someone told me last night to follow the river, going in the opposite direction.",
          "I've never felt so helpless and nervous. The river was easy enough to find, and I followed it blindly as it flowed beneath me. For a long time there weren't any other pilgrims ahead, or behind, and I started to have a minor panic attack. Finally I saw some ahead of me, and at the same moment the markers on the ground returned. Crisis averted.",
          "The first mistake of the morning was slowly becoming apparent to me. I had not filled up my Camelbak before leaving because I assumed that public fountains would be on and running. Apparently they turn them off at night, and don't turn them on again until later in the day. I felt another panic attack coming.",
          "As I left the city behind and entered the familiar world of the gravel path and green fields, I came across a stone marker that made me want to cry.",
          "Standing in front of me is a pink heart with a crack going down the middle of it, and that perfectly summed up how I was feeling. I was now an hour away from everyone that I had grown so close to over the last several days, with no hopes of ever seeing them again.",
          "I pushed my feelings aside, and decided that they wouldn’t bring me down today.",
          "Quick work was made of the walk to Tarjados where I grabbed another, more filling, breakfast, filled up on water and then headed through Rabé de las Calzadas a short distance later.",
          "Once I left Rabé the heat, and flies, began to rise. Little did I know but I was entering the Meseta on June 14th, and a heatwave was beginning to sweep across Spain at the same time.",
          "The flies were my unwanted traveling companions on this 30+ kilometer day, and they did not want to leave me alone. But, there was silver lining to this swarm of annoying flies, and that was a swarm of white butterflies.",
          "I crested a hill and was surrounded by hundreds of them. They kept the flies away, and it was like walking through a dream. Sadly I have no pictures of this amazing world, I was too focused on pushing through this day.",
          "Besides the flies, and the heat, the world around me was once again composed of blue sky, green fields, and white clouds. This is my element. This is where I feel at home.",
          "Some benches stood in front of a bar at the edge of Hornillos del Camino. As I sat there eating my sandwich some Brits were staring at me, and I tried my best to ignore there eyes. Further up the road was the town square so I headed towards it and the Church. I grabbed a table by a fountain in front of the church, and enjoyed the rest of my sandwich along with a beer from the bar.",
          "As much as I was enjoying myself in the sun, there was still plenty of walking left to do. The ground after Hornillos was flat as far as the eye could see. Here and there piles of rocks in the distance gave the illusion of buildings and salvation from the flies and the heat (oh yes, the flies immediately returned once I left the village behind).",
          "According to the map they had given me back in St Jean there was supposed to be a rest stop after 26 kilometers called San Bol. Only one ruined building remained in the fields of grass. Disheartened, I cracked on.",
          "Next came a sign promising a place to sleep in 500 meters. Then another sign promising the same in 250 meters. Then another at 50 meters. 50 meters is exactly 164.042 feet. You can see 164 feet in front of you, right? 164 feet in front me was nothing, just more flat grasslands filled with flies.",
          "I started cursing out loud because I was running low on water, very hot, and my feet were killing me. Then, out of nowhere, Hontanas rose from the ground like the cave filled with gold in Aladdin. First the top of the church, then the tops of buildings, and finally a street that led down and into sanctuary. The entire city was built below the level of the surrounding terrain.",
          "Words alone cannot describe how I felt.",
          "At the top of the gravel road leading into town were some other pilgrims. Hopefully they were American. My greeting started as a simple \"hey\" to the person closest to me, but quickly turned into a cry of excitement as I saw who it was, and I nearly collapsed on them as I gave them a hug.",
          "Disbelief overcame me as I stepped back and turned to look further down the road. There was Bianca who I had seen during the earlier days of the Camino at Najera, and a new pilgrim named Mauro from Italy. And of course there was the person whom I had just assaulted with a hug. This was the person who had left so early in the morning nearly three days ago in Belorado without saying goodbye. But there she was, standing two feet away from me. I was so happy to be able to say hello, once again, to Crissi.",
          "Relief, joy, and a multitude of other feelings overcame me, and I could not wipe the look of happiness off of my face as we went into town, booked beds, and relaxed in the sun. The universe had given me new and old friends to help pull me up and get me through one of the hardest days of my life after leaving so many people behind.",
          "Another pilgrim that Crissi recognized named Ciro stopped by our table that afternoon. He told us that he had done five Caminos so far! That's crazy, but I can see why someone would want to come back and do this again.",
          "Bianca, Crissi, Mauro, and I scrapped together what we could from the small tienda, and cooked dinner for each other. This was my first time on the Camino cooking dinner, and it couldn't have been under better circumstances. We even blew out the circuit breakers because we were using the electric stove so much.",
          "The setting sun basked the rear deck in hot light as we enjoyed the fruits of our collective labor. It was one of the most delicious dinners I had ever had. Ciro joined us halfway through as we were finishing up the bottle of wine.",
          "It was decided that we would leave early in the morning to try and beat this intense heat that was laying on top of the world like a heavy wool blanket. The Meseta, the rest of the Camino, and Boadilla del Camino was waiting for us. Let's do this."

          "The sun would not rise for another two hours as we packed our bags in the hallway. Someone else from the other dormitory had the same idea, and added their stuff to the mess. We finished our morning routines and headed down the stairs.",
          "There's really only one thing that can stop you from getting an early start, and that would be a locked door. Thirteen days of walking to, and sleeping in, various places. You'd think that we would have learned to ask what time the doors open. After some exploring we found our escape through the kitchen door, and around the back of the building.",
          "With head torches aglow we headed up into the hills and out of town. There’s not much to see when it’s dark out, and you walk so much faster without the heat pressing down on you. Our small group for the day consisted of Bianca, Crissi, and Maddy (the pilgrim who joined us in the hallway) from the UK.",
          "The rising sun filled the sky with a beautiful pink as headed towards Castrojeriz. Up ahead a massive structure begin to take shape. It was the Convento de San Antón: an old pilgrim hospital which was started by the Order of St. Anthony in the 11th century. All that's left now are the ruins of it, but the road cut right through the middle of it.",
          "Arches toward above us as we walked through the ruins. The pink stone arches of this once massively tall structure framed the road perfectly as we continued towards the castle on the hill in the distance.",
          "The road took us through groves of trees before crossing a small river. Castrojeriz was in full view as we took the exit off of the small country highway and towards the town. The church seemed so large when compared to the houses around it.",
          "Oh, and did I mention that there wasn't a single cloud in the sky today? Talk about beautiful.",
          "Bianca showed us her coffee skills as we rested at the cafe across from the church. She competes in the Olympics of coffee making, and gets to work with it all day long, for a living.",
          "Up the stone road we went, taking a detour around the southern side of the castle on the hill, and in doing so nearly stepped on a praying mantis! The little guy was standing as stiff as a statue in the middle of the street. But he was kind enough to let us take some pictures of him.",
          "Ahead of us lay an old Roman road which led to the big elevation gain for the day: Alto de Mostelares. Maddy and I were in the power walking groove with our trekking poles, and we didn’t flinch as we hit the incline. It took us about 10 minutes to get to the top, and holy shit were we out of breath when we reached it. I don’t think I was this out of breath when we crossed the Pyrenees.",
          "The walk down was hard. My poor knees…",
          "Flat ground awaited us on our way to the next oasis. The power walking didn’t ease up either. Maddy and I arrived at the Fuente al Pioja about 40 minutes later and chucked our gear aside. We probably spent close to an hour resting here. The sun was shining bright, the clouds were absent from the sky, and the shade felt damn good. Plus, there was a snack stand set up with food. Fruit please!",
          "We came to the San Nicolás Chapel. It was a barebones place with no electricity which means, gasp, no wifi. But the thought of staying there was tempting, just to disconnect from it all for once. Once over the bridge which crossed the Rio Pisuerga we entered Palencia, and the Tierra de Campos region.",
          "The headphones went in, the music was turned on, and I beat the shit out of that gravel path with my trekking poles. The heat had turned up, and I wanted to get to some shade, which was still 6 kilometers away. Maddy had the same idea, and she kept in time with her music, each of us using the beat to power walk. We matched tempos and were soon making great time.",
          "Itero de la Vega was the next town, and it was calling out to us for lunch. The sandwiches were served hot, the beer cold, and I fell backwards into my chair as I tried to stand up. Maybe I need to slow down a bit. Gently rolling hills outside of Itero de la Vega greeted us for the longest stretch of today. No water, no shade, good music, rolling hills, what more could you ask for?",
          "With beast mode turned on it took Maddy and I about an hour to get to the shade and stop for the day at Boadilla del Camino.",
          "During our speed walking, we realized that Crissi and Bianca had fallen far, far behind. We waited with the most friendly of cats at the park on the edge of the village for an hour, but they never showed up. It was too early in the day to call it quits and, oddly enough, we were aching for more walking.",
          "Bad idea.",
          "The walk from Boadilla to Fromista was nearly just as long as the previous stretch, and along an old river canal (Canal de Castilla) that looked like it was no longer used. We were very relieved when we entered town at three in the afternoon. Today came close to 10 hours of pure walking. Not bad. But we both knew that it was going to start hurting soon.",
          "Happy to be at another large town, we checked in at the closest place to stay and settled in. The World Cup was going on while we were in Spain, and Maddy’s Camino friend Luis was staying at the same Albergue, so we joined him at night for the game.",
          "It was officially decided that we shouldn’t have pushed so hard today. But hey, second longest day! Crissi and Bianca did indeed make it to the previous town at Boadilla after we had left, and decided to camp there for the night. But we'll see them tomorrow in Carrion, the town just before what I would later learn is called The Wasteland.",
          "With a name like that, I'm not looking forward to it."

          "The sun was still sleeping as we packed up, and started heading for Carrión de los Condes. After yesterdays blazingly fast speed it will be a relief to walk at a more calm and steady pace. But soon after passing through Poblacion de Campos Maddy had to stop and take it easy for a while. She urged me to keep going, and promised to catch up.",
          "The trail markers stood like guardians on the path at each road crossing, and it felt like entering a gate when passing through them. Todays trail hugged the newly built road between the cities of Fromista and Carrion.",
          "With the sun was rising behind me I marched along the gravel path, passing each kilometer marker at a steady pace. With each passing marker I was getting more and more annoyed. It wasn't fun being constantly reminded of how far I had to go. I liked not knowing the incremental distance and just pushing on to the end of the stage for the day.",
          "Villarmentero de Campos offered the first chance for food. The only place that looked like it had food was at a bar with scarecrows and mannequins arranged in the yard. The hostess also seemed a bit off, so I inhaled the croissant and banana, used the bathroom, and quickly returned to the road and the ever present kilometer markers.",
          "This would be the only pitstop before arriving at Carrion.",
          "In Villalcazar de Sirga I took the detour through the town center, and passed by the church. Supposedly it was the last one built by the Templars? After Villalcazar I would pause every so often and turn around, hoping to spot Maddy behind me, but no dots appeared on the horizon.",
          "The final walk in to Carrion seemed to take forever thanks to the unchanging scenery, but at 10am I walked into the town square. Bar Carmen was the first place I spotted that looked halfway decent, and grabbed some breakfast while waiting for the others to arrive. My Spanish definitely needs some practice: the bartender had a hard time understanding me, but we got through it together.",
          "After eating I took a tour of the side streets and did some shopping. I needed to get a new money belt, and sun glasses, as both had been destroyed earlier in the day. Luckily there was a hiking gear shop that had a good money belt. The sunglasses were bought in some bazaar style shop that sold one of everything, but you can't go wrong for six euros.",
          "Two hours later Crissi and Bianca texted me to say that they found some beds at an old monastery called Monestario de Santa Clara. It was finally time to abandon my post at the bar, and I'm sure the owner was happy to see me go. The place we're staying at doesn't have any Wi-Fi, but we’re cooking dinner again! We did some shopping and then headed back to the monastery and hung out in the courtyard. We got pretty tipsy from the wine we bought, and snacked on some meats, cheeses, and grapes.",
          "I also bought my first souvenir of the trip: a small pin in the shape of a yellow arrow, which is one of the main symbols on the Camino.",
          "While the sun was high in the sky, and the temps were approaching the upper 90’s, Crissi and I did some exploring of the parks near the river. Before dinner we all checked out a lovely Spanish guitar performance at the local church.",
          "Ciro from Hontanas cooked us dinner and oh my God it was freaking delicious, and filling. I probably won't have to eat for another three days. It's a shame we couldn't save the leftovers and take them with us. Crissi and I did the dishes while singing along to 1985 and Wannabe by the Spice Girls. It was quite the performance.",
          "Tomorrow we are crossing The Wasteland with 18 kilometers of nothing, literally. The Meseta would be unbearable if it weren’t for the beautiful cities dotting its landscape, and the people you meet."

          "Want to know a great way to start your day? First, buy some liquid deodorant when you get into town at night, and in the morning when you're about leave take it out and shake it vigorously. Keep shaking it until a stray drop finds its way into your eye. Now that you're half-blind, and possibly puffy-eyed, reluctantly put on your glasses. Not the best way to start what would become one of the longest days on the camino.",
          "At 5:30am, bound for the stretch of the Camino that some called The Wasteland, we left Carrion and in no time at all we were walking the ancient Roman route known as the Via Aquitana.",
          "The green trees in the distance separated the gray world above us from the yellow world around us, with the white gravel path never faltering as it shot across the land.",
          "With very little to see, or do, we kept our heads down and focused on the walking. Luckily the clouds hung around all morning and kept the temperature down. Some folks played their music, but mostly everyone was focused on the destination.",
          "And it wasn't all that bad. It only took us 3.5 hours of walking, and one stop at a small area with benches, to reach the end of this 17 kilometer stretch in Calzadilla de la Cueza. Believe it or not, I'm halfway to Santiago!",
          "The clouds disappeared after breakfast in Calzadilla as we continued towards Ledigos, and Terradillos de los Templarios. As the sun shined down upon us, the temperatures rose.",
          "Crissi and I were walking so fast that as we entered Ledigos we realized that we had left Bianca behind. We waited around for her to show up, but she never did. She most likely took a break earlier on without us noticing.",
          "We arrived at Terradillos de los Templarios just after noon. There was a little picnic area amongst what appeared to be the ruins of an old well, and we found a few other pilgrims there. This was the first spot of shade since leaving Calzadilla, so we joined them at the stone table with some cold cokes.",
          "Terradillos was technically a stage ender, but Crissi and I were feeling adventurous (or crazy) and decided to push on. We said our goodbyes and hit the road once more, deciding to make it as far as Sahagún before calling it quits for the day. If only we had known how much it was going to hurt.",
          "We spent the next hour making bets on how much further we had to go before we would see the next town (I lost them all), and talking about why we disliked our jobs and what we were going to do about it. It was here that I think I officially decided to start looking for something new.",
          "Finally, after losing the second bet, we reached the top of a hill and spied Moratinos sitting a kilometer away. Several stone messages, and arrows, dotted the path as we hiked downhill into town.",
          "They had their own little Hobbitville here which were actually Bodegas (a sign literally said \"No, Hobbits do NOT live here\"). Trees wrapped in blankets dominated the small town square in front of the church as we headed out. A few kilometers later we came upon San Nicolás del Real Camino. A local Albergue had an attached restaurant, which meant more sugar-filled Coca Cola, and making sure we were ready to do the final push to Sahagún.",
          "We arrived in the city at 4pm after taking an odd, twisting, path that took us out of our way just so we could see an old church, and some stone statues. Thanks Camino.",
          "The Municipal Albergue in this city was an old church, and the beds + kitchen + bathrooms were in the upper level/attic of the church. We got to choose our beds before checking in and paying. This place, oddly, had the best Wi-Fi so far on the Camino. I updated my music library later that night because listening to the same songs for 16 days gets old, fast.",
          "Not much was in our little area of town, and after walking 40 kilometers we were not in the mood for exploring the city by foot. There was a small hostel cafe across the street from the church, and Bianca walked by as we were checking it out. We were so happy to see her, and to see that she made it safe 'n sound. By now it was getting close to 6pm and we were overdue for our afternoon naps.",
          "It was Sunday, and nothing was open, which meant no cooking tonight. We retired to our beds, but ended up napping for too long. We awoke in the evening, around 8pm or so.",
          "Crissi and I grabbed a late dinner at a large restaurant across the street, and watched part of the world cup game. As we were leaving the restaurant Luis found us and practically dropped to his knees. He had forgotten the passcode for the church door and was panicking thinking that he would have to sleep outside tonight.",
          "Today’s walking total was 39 kilometers, the longest stretch yet. It felt as bad as the walk into Hontanas three days earlier. I guess after a certain point the pain is the same. For me, it usually kicks in around 20 kilometers, which in an odd way helps me know how much ground has been covered for the day. Tomorrow is hopefully an easier day, seeing as how we did 1.5 stages today. Our planned destination is Mansilla, but we'll see if that actually happens."

          "Today started like the others: rise early, and beat the heat. Our exit from Sahagún in the pre-dawn hours was a quiet one. Most of the other pilgrims at the church were still sleeping, including Bianca. The streets were empty as we got our first look at the churches. We passed through the arch of San Benito, followed the yellow arrows on the ground, and before we knew it we were out of the city.",
          "We took in the sun rising behind us as we walked silently, and quickly, to Calzada de Coto five kilometers away. Nothing was open this early in the morning, and Mondays in Spain are treated somewhat like Sundays (another day of rest). Luckily we found breakfast at an Albergue in Calzadilla de los Hermanillos approximately nine kilometers further on. And it's a good thing to, because it was 9:30 am and the heat was returning.",
          "In the distance I could see the mountains that would be welcoming us in about a week, and couldn't wait to be done with all of the flatness!",
          "After breakfast we headed for the second longest Wasteland stretch of the Meseta, the one that no one told us about. And from what we could see, we were the only pilgrims who chose this route. The others must have chosen the route that goes along the highway.",
          "A short while later we came to the end of the paved road at a T-junction, but The Way continued forward into the endlessly flat world on a trail covered in brown-red dirt. The first Camino marker after leaving the paved road had a single beat-up shoe resting on it. Not a good sign. I half expected to see vultures circling overhead.",
          "We were now on another ancient Roman road. Those guys really knew how to pick 'em. This one was called Via Trajana. And despite the fact that we were in a hot dry place, I still thought it was cool that we were walking on history. Can't always say that back in the States.",
          "With nothing but dried up fields in the visible distance, and the dirt path forever going forward through it, we put our headphones in and cracked on. There was zero shade as the sun relentlessly shined down on our backs.",
          "After about two hours in to the hellish walk another pilgrim caught up, overcame us, and left us behind in her dust. And once again, we were alone in this dry world.",
          "At one point, probably about 2/3 of the way through, I lost track of Crissi walking behind me. I quickly doubled back, fearing that she had fallen or tripped. Thankfully she was simply resting in some hard to find shade on the side of the trail. She had also run out of water so I gave her my water bottle reserves.",
          "An old train depot up ahead had long ago been abandoned, and no town was in sight. There was a train moving in the distance in the direction of our travel, so hopefully we were getting close...",
          "Slowly a line of trees in the distance began to materialize, and I prayed that this would mean the end of the wasteland. We were now three hours into this stretch, which is how much time it took us to finish yesterdays wasteland. But alas, no end was near.",
          "To our surprise, we came across an old French man who was returning to St Jean after reaching Santiago. I was in awe that anyone would want to walk this part of The Way again. What a mad man, I said. At last we reached the trees which stood as a physical, and symbolic, end to the longest hottest dryest stretch of walking I've ever done in life. Through the trees we saw bulls feasting on piles of potatoes.",
          "After exiting the small patch of trees and not seeing any town, or any sign of a town, I started cursing the earth, my shoes, and the distance. The pain was incredible. My supply of water was gone, and the water bottle that I had given to Crissi was nearly empty. If we didn't make it to a town within the next hour or so, we were going to have issues.",
          "We crossed over a modern bridge that had some sort of importance (I can't remember what exactly), all I remember is that the hand railing was too hot to touch. There were some informational signs before and after the bridge that described the land around us and its history. I ignored them and, going against all logic, I decided to walk even faster!",
          "In the distance I could see what looked like a lighthouse at the top of a hill. It was a metallic pyramid shaped structure at the top of what looked like a radio tower. It was a shining beacon that told us we were about to arrive in a town, and arrive at sanctuary. With every curve in the path (which was now a white gravel), I turned around in order to make sure Crissi was still behind me.",
          "Reliegos was another town that appeared out of nowhere. At the edge of the hill I spotted the town below. I started walking faster and faster, eager to get out of this dirt and onto paved road. Bad idea. The paved road felt so much worse than the gravel path. I had to sit down on the curb. I couldn't go any further now that I was within the town limits.",
          "Crissi arrived a few minutes later, and we decided to stay at an Albergue behind a bar.",
          "This stretch should really be the one known as The Wasteland since it’s 10x worse than the first one. It took us nearly four hours to cross it and there were literally no places to stop or find shade. Water was not available, and the unrelenting heat plus sun are a deadly combo. But, it was pretty at some points.",
          "I passed out immediately after eating. My dreams, when I do dream on the Camino, have been crystal clear and very vivid. Maybe it’s because I lack the level of external stimuli that I normally receive at home, since all I’m doing is walking, and being in incredible amounts of pain. Or maybe it's just the opposite, and it's this activity that is putting my brain into overdrive at night.",
          "After a successful stop at a local grocery store we grabbed dinner with two people from Holland: Walter and Yo-yo. Luis also found us, or maybe we found him, but either way we were happy to see a familiar face.",
          "Needless to say, we went to bed early tonight. Our room only had six beds in it, and the bathroom was really nice. But the room was filled with snorers, and my earplugs kept popping out. After a walk like today, I needed all the sleep that I could get. We decided to try and sleep in tomorrow. Leon was our destination, and the end of this flat land."

          "Goodbye flat land, hello hills. It felt great sleeping in today. We didn't roll out of bed until well after the sun was up and the other pilgrims had left. I was eager to start walking, despite the lingering effects from yesterday. We departed for León with the goal of leaving the Meseta far, far, behind. The rising sun looked like an atom bomb had been detonated in the distance.",
          "Cows kept us company on the walk towards the old castle-fort city of Mansilla de las Mulas. As per usual nothing was open and our pace didn't falter as we walked through the city. Several groups of students spilled out of the Albergue and onto the streets, laughing, dressed in relaxing clothes. At first we were impressed that they would agree to do something like this at such an early age, but then we saw them loading their bags into a van.",
          "The sun was not cooperating as I tried to take a picture of the castle walls on the way out. Around that time a bird decided to poop on my shirt, and I was forced to wear it as a badge of shame for the rest of the day. It was chocolate for anyone who asked.",

It was tucked away from the highway in the towns’ square, and the plaza was covered in white and yellow polka-dots. Probably one of the stranger towns I've seen so far, but they had fresh Spanish tortilla and bocadillos! I splurged and bought both.",
          "Villarente and Arcahuega stood no chance as we powered through them, covering the 12 kilometers in a few hours. Most of the path took us along highways, and through the busy downtown areas. Sometimes it would switch it up and take us under bridges, or down along a river.",
          "They were doing construction on part of the path, so we had to take a different route for entering León. The uphill battle was worse than I expected. It was on paved road for the most part, but finally as we got near the top it diverted into the woods, and oh what a sight it was after we cleared the trees.",
          "We raced down the dirt path that took us onto a county road. Here we followed the markers as they led us through the rugged and increasingly modern areas of the city. I like the transition from modern to old, especially when the old town your entering has a wall around it.",
          "The Benedictine church where we wanted to spend the night was hard to find. We must have asked at least three different people where it was, and walked an extra two kilometers around the city, but finally we found it. Crissi and I walked around looking for food, and found a bar that served \"rustic bread\". Basically it was large slices of various breads with toppings on them, but they were super delicious. We returned to the Albergue to meet up with Bianca, and then took her to the same bar, just because we liked it so much.",
          "After drinking and eating we explored the city, with me playing the tour guide. First stop was the cathedral, of course. Two pilgrims where walking in at the same time, and we convinced them to join us in order to get the ticket discount deal for a group. This was a true gothic cathedral: it was large and grand on the inside with the columns drawing your eyes up, up, and up.",
          "Next we went to a basilica, then a house designed by Gaudi, and finally the city park.",
          "On the way back we found a bar to grab some beers and people watched for a while. Ciro, limping, found us on the way back to the church. He had to buy some new shoes because his current pair had taken off most of his toenails! Yeah, that's a real thing that can happen if you walk for extended periods of time.",
          "Dinner was a pilgrims menu at the restaurant next to the the church, which gives discounts for those staying there.",
          "There's now only two weeks left before reaching Santiago! Nights spent in places like Logroño, or Nájera, feel like they were ages ago, and yet also felt like they were only yesterday.",
          "I am thankful that today was a relatively easy walk, with plenty of places to stop and eat, or to get water. I have no idea what tomorrow holds, partly because we don't know which way to go (there are two routes), and we don't know how far we're going to make it."

          "Creaking beds and rustling backpacks acted like an alarm clock, except this one didn't have a snooze button. Once the lights came on it was nearly impossible to try and ignore the fact that another day had begun. We've been lazy lately by allowing ourselves to sleep in, but we're not complaining. Business as usual: pack your bag, grab toast and jam (which no longer suffices as breakfast), brush your teeth, and head out. Crissi was the last to join us in the courtyard, and we started walking.",
          "Stone streets glistened in the light of the rising sun as it shown down middle of the avenue as we passed by the cathedral. After a quick stop for some coffee we said goodbye to the old city center and started to head out of town.",
          "It took most of the morning for us to even make it out of the city.",
          "The Way went past the scenic landmarks towards the Plaza de San Marcos which had several monuments to the pilgrims. We crossed the Rio Bernesga and walked through more metropolitan areas, some of them industrial with fields of weeds opposite their gray buildings.",
          "Finally after a short uphill gain, walking along a busy highway, and two hours later, we arrived in Virgen del camino. Starving, we stopped at a small bar on the side of the road. Crissi and Bianca were amazed that we had been walking through León this whole time, and only now finally left the city behind.",
          "We picked up a new companion to walk with us for the day: Kim from Australia.",
          "The time had come for a decision: stay on the highway and go down the alternate route, or follow the traditional scenic route. Crissi and I remembered how badly we had been burned (literally) the last time we chose the scenic route. Chiro had also told us that the scenic route was terrible but we decided to ignore his advice because no one wanted to spend three hours walking along a busy noisy highway.",
          "Our scenic route had to cross through a scraggly patch of earth in order to cross one more highway. Luckily it was an underpass which took us to Fresno del Camino, but we left the town almost as fast as we had entered it for there wasn't much to see.",
          "Oncina was the next town after Fresno. We stopped at a small church after crossing the bridge into town. Disappointed that the snack shop next to the church wasn't open we stocked up on water at the fountain and took the small paved road as it transitioned into a pleasant dirt path through the fields.",
          "At last, the scenic route had arrived.",
          "Sure, it was still mostly flat. But it still possessed enough of a change to keep it interesting. And, we were surrounded by vegetation on all sides. One thing we won't be escaping any time soon though is the red dirt. Looks like this shit will be following us for quite a while.",
          "I walked fast today, and quickly pulled ahead of the others. Nothing but gently rolling fields dotted with islands of ground green trees kept me company as I pushed myself past shady rest areas. The dirt path gradually shifted back into a paved road, which sucks. But the sun was out, the sky empty, and thankfully the heat was late to the party.",
          "A spare pair of shoes stood on a marker as an offering to any pilgrim who might need them. Besides the plants growing inside of them, and the absence of shoelaces, they were in pretty good shape. And to be honest, the thought of grabbing them briefly crossed my mind, but then I thought of the extra weight and quickly discarded the idea.",
          "Chozas de Abajo, and a much needed break, appeared in the distance as I topped the next hill. I waited at the entrance of the town for the others to catch up and see me. I slowly headed into the center whilst making sure that they were still behind me. We found the only open establishment and took a break on its front porch.",
          "When we walked up and dropped our bags I recognized Drew whom I had briefly met in Pamplona while walking around with Tania. And a few moments later another Pilgrim arrived and joined us at our table. Her name was Cerstin from Germany, and she had started her camino in Burgos.",
          "I'm not sure who suggested it, but there was an albergue up ahead that had a swimming pool. It was a no brainer, given the high temps over the past few days. So, our home for the night would hopefully be Casa de Jesus.",
          "On the walk to Mazarife I grilled Cerstin on the political systems of Germany. It was a nice way to pass the next hour.",
          "We arrived at Casa de Jesus, and sure enough, there it was: the swimming pool. We were eager to strip down to our skivvies and go for a dip, especially in this hot sun, but first we needed to do some shopping for dinner.",
          "Afterwards we sat chatting with Louis, Crissi, Kim, Cerstin, Hannah (Germany), and Drew. We went over all of the things that are different between British, German, Aussie, and American culture. It was hilarious, especially the animal noises.",
          "Once the sun finally moved out of high position in the sky Cerstin and I swam in the pool for a bit before cooking dinner.",
          "Our meal cost a total of 14 euros, which isn't bad for 8 people. The kitchen was tiny, and everyone needed to use it, so we made sure to not use all of the electric stove burners again and trip another circuit breaker.",
          "As we all sat down to eat it was nice to see the table fill up with friends who were slowly becoming like family. Dinner consisted of another lovely course of salad, pasta with capers, and bread.",
          "I sat outside for a while afterwards chatting with Cerstin and Drew. Drew, it turns out, got his entire camino trip sponsored by entering a contest of sorts in which he would promise to write about the Camino and promote the websites brand. Not a bad idea!",
          "Maddy, who has a younger sister, found out that her sister will be arriving later tonight and will join us on the Camino starting tomorrow.",
          "The gray clouds in the distance were slowly growing in size, pushing their way higher and higher into the sky, as a busload of children arrived. They stayed in another part of the Albergue and would be doing two days of the Camino, starting tomorrow.",
          "We watched the clouds as they moved closer. Tomorrow was going to be another 30+ kilometer day, and hopefully the rain would pass us by."

          "I woke in the middle of the night, and felt the energy in the air. The breeze coming through the open windows shifted from warm to cold, and rumblings in the distance confirmed it: the rain had arrived. With much reluctance I shut the window closest to my bed, I knew it was going to get stuffy in here really quickly with it closed.",
          "The rain helped to mute the sound of those in the room who were snoring, and I fell back to sleep. We agreed to wake early again today because of the ever present heat, and a few hours later I was up.",
          "The floor in the inner part of the building was exposed to the sky, and it was covered in a minefield of water puddles. I got my stuff ready in the dining room where we shared dinner the previous night. Crissi was eager to get going, and she departed before the rest of us.",
          "With darkness enveloping the small village, and the street lights carving out orange cones of light, I turned on my head torch and headed out of town. The way out was easy to find thanks to it being a straight paved road shooting off into the distance.",
          "More heads down walking along the road while avoiding the occasional car.",
          "The sun started to ignite the sky as it struggled to break out from the thick clouds that concealed it near the horizon. Forty minutes later it broke free, and illuminated the world around me.",
          "I walked through endless farmlands as the road approached a T-junction in the distance. Flies and snails were out in force this morning, taking up the entire path both on the ground and in the air.",
          "Here the path veered off to the left after crossing the junction, and then took a sharp right, as it turned into a wide mud-filled dirt trail. More farmlands surrounded me as I zig-zagged my way along, avoiding the puddles of water.",
          "On a few occasions I spotted Crissi's shoe print in the mud, and knew that I mustn't be too far behind her. After a while the path veered off to the right through stacks of earth and hay, as the first town on todays trek, Villabente, appeared. I saw nothing of interest in the town, and kept going via a winding route that went through the city's center, and passed some lumber warehouses before arriving on the dirt path once more. Train tracks ahead forced a 90 degree turn to the right.",
          "As I followed alongside the tracks, I quickened my pace in hopes of reaching Crissi in the next, larger, town called Hospital de Orbigo. But a faster pace meant that I couldn't be as nimble as I would have preferred when it came to avoiding the massive legions of white-shelled snails that were occupying the white gravel path. I tried my best, but I know I probably stepped on several of them. A large stone arrow in the middle of the path told me that I was still going in the proper direction.",
          "Hospital de Orbigo's entrance deliberately went around all sides of an industrial site before having to run across a busy street in order to continue on the path on other side of a roundabout.",
          "The yellow arrows, and curvy road art, led me to Bar El Puente. It had a garden full of colorful small birds. With no breakfast to be had, I bought a banana and an apple before heading for the bridge.",
          "The bridge was the site of a legendary medieval jousting competition. There’s a huge backstory to it, and you should read about it, but the bridge itself is called El Paso Honroso (The Honorable Pass).",
          "I decided to skip breakfast here since the only offerings were at expensive restaurants, and it ended up being a good decision because on my way out of town I ran in to Crissi. She was debating taking the road route along the highway (nay), or the scenic route through the hills and trees (yay). I \"made\" her choose the scenic route.",
          "The next town at Villares de Orbigo had an open cafe, and the food was so cheap that both Crissi and I got some food. A minor uphill gravel path took us to the widest red dirt path that I've ever seen. We took this down, around, and over another highway.",
          "A few more kilometers and we were entering Santibanez de Valdeiglesias. Bianca randomly spotted us at the top of the road as we were leaving and called us over. As we waited for her to pack up, we randomly ran into Mauro at an Albergue! He was just getting started on this day, so he promised to catch up.",
          "We marched along the red dirt paths through various forests, up and over hills, and over large rocks, and I spotted several large and odd looking bugs. The pictures above don't do the scenery justice though. Even though it was very red, it was very beautiful.",
          "A couple hours later and we arrived at a trail angel stop known as Casa de Los Dioses. It was a free food and drink place, with plenty of cushioned seats in the shade. We even got to sign our names onto the side of the house. And the host was quite a character himself.",
          "Another thirty minutes would pass before getting our first views of Astorga at the cross on the hill overlooking the city. We passed through San Justo de la Vega and continued to follow the road for a while until we came to bright white gravel path. It rain alongside the backs of several warehouse buildings.",
          "The only shade was a thin sliver next to the buildings. After a turn in the path we came to giant green ramp structure that would take us up and over some train tracks. Initially this made me mad because we had just done all of that walking, and then to have to go up and down several ramps just to get over some train tracks. We followed the road again, sticking to the narrow sidewalks where we could, pass a roundabout and up a steep ramp towards the old part of the city.",
          "There was an Albergue at the top of this ramp, right inside the city, but we initially ignored it because I thought it looked like a hospital. After a few more moments we decided to turn around and head to the place. It ended up being a good place, especially at five euros. It had great views of the surrounding countryside thanks to our rooms being on the top floor.",
          "The nicety of the amenities stopped there.",
          "There were zero outlets near the beds, the showers were so hot they nearly scalded my skin, they made us stay on the top floor because “we are young”, the bathroom toilet stalls were super tiny and I could barely move in them, and finally there is no air circulation.",
          "But it was only five euros, so I took it in stride.",
          "We grabbed much needed beers and food at a local bar. I did some more gear repacking, got rid of stuff that I just didn’t need, and was able to get rid of my first aid kit plastic bag! But somehow my bag still feels way to full.",
          "After repacking, I suddenly became very aware of the pain in my knee (especially after going up and down five flights of stairs several times). I went to the pharmacy and got a brace for my knee, along with some cream for my finger (which somehow got an infection near the finger nail). The knee brace feels great when going downhill, and down stairs. I should have gotten this earlier.",
          "I met up with Cerstin near the cathedral and we took a quick walk around town. We decided to not go inside the cathedral, or do the touristy tours. It looked like every other church after we stuck our heads inside for a quick peek.",
          "Cerstin invited me to dinner with her, another German pilgrim, and a mother-daughter duo from Europe. They were making pancakes for dinner, and we had “real” German beer called Kriek with it. The food and the beer were both really good. I felt ashamed for having not helped prepare any of it.",
          "The weather is gearing up for another storm, and the rain blew through without much warning. All of the clothes hanging outside got soaked. It's still hot and stuffy in our room, even after that torrent of wind and rain. Looks like it'll be another night of no clothes. But I'm excited, because tomorrow we are officially returning to the mountains."

          "Sleep escaped my grasp in the hot, stale, attic that they called a dormitory. Echos from the bathrooms below forced us to close the door, cutting off the only circulation that kept the temperature in the room bearable. There were two gables at either end of the room each with one small window, but they were not up to the task of providing enough fresh air.",
          "The gentle vibrations underneath my pillow at 6am pulled me away from what little sleep I was able to achieve. It was still dark out as I set my glasses down on the ledge beneath the open window in the bathroom, and got myself ready for the day.",
          "Some of the people were still sleeping as I carried my gear out of the room and dropped it in the small landing area outside the door. Others followed suit, and before long we were making so much noise that the rest of them woke up.",
          "No breakfast was available at this place, so we saddled up and headed out to the street below. Our first stop  on the way towards the cathedral was the ATM in order to load up on cash. We met up with Maddy and her sister was we walked past the cathedral and headed out of town.",
          "A small road lined with trees took us out of the city, and over a highway to Murias de Rechivaldo. It was too early to stop for breakfast, and without pause the march continued through farm fields towards Santa Catalina de Somoza, and breakfast at Albergue El Caminante.",
          "White gravel paths, just a few feet from a road that was as black as night, consumed the view during todays walk. The surface of the ground surrounding this path and road was mostly scraggly rock. Green trees on our right, white ground beneath our feet, and black roads to our left. This was the landscape for most of the morning.",
          "After a while The Way detoured to the right, over a small bridge, and into the trees. Here, at this turn of the path just before it entered the woods, stood a multi-colored tent with a box for donations. I thought it was a small snack stand, but I failed to notice that there was a hawk sitting on a perch five feet away. I also failed to notice the man dressed as a knight in chainmail, and all of his replica medieval weapons.",
          "Turns out he helps collect donations for Asociación Gaudisse. His shtick is to dress as a knight, and allow passing pilgrims to pet the hawk. We each took turns with the hawk, even those of us who were too scared to touch it. The bird was very well behaved.",
          "The next leg of our journey that morning took us uphill through trees and over uneven terrain. An earthen path followed the road at a distance through the trees. Finally we left the road behind, and entered Rabanal del Camino.",
          "I convinced my camino friends to keep walking further into town instead of stopping at the first spot we saw, and we were rewarded for this persistence with a wonderful oasis at The Green Garden. It had comfortable woven chairs and cushioned chaise lounges under the trees, free tents for camping, cheap ice cream and Coca Cola, and plenty of dogs and cats to pet and treat with left overs from our bocadillos.",
          "We honestly thought about camping here under the stars, since it was free, but we took one look at the outdoor bathroom and collectively said “Nope”.",
          "Some of our group decided to relax for a little while longer, and the rest of us continued on and began the hike up, up and up. Somewhere along the way, as we were scrambling over some rocks, Cerstin decided to invent a new word for this called Auf Stein (Up Stone).",
          "The road was never far away, and the sounds of cars going by slightly ruined the ambience of nature.",
          "Further up there was a small shelter with the words “Walking Proud” written on the roof, and it had a small natural water fountain in front of it. I washed my head in those cold refreshing waters; a much needed reprieve from the sun and heat.",
          "Up and up we went through the woods over streams, rocks, and fallen trees. A couple of hours later we arrived at Foncebadón. There are so many ruined buildings, and outlines of structures that once stood here. This used to be a large town in the past, and it had all but been forgotten about until the revival of the camino several years ago. Now there is new construction every which way you turn.",
          "We checked in to a Druid themed Albergue, and found some of our other friends whom we had become separated with earlier in the day. Dinner was a burger across the street at a bar while we watched some of the World Cup. We tried to watch the sunset from up here, but the clouds did not cooperate.",
          "It was very humbling to be able to stand on the grassy hill behind our Albergue after the sun had begun to set, and see all of the towns we passed through today lite up. The sunrise from up here is going to be epic. I can’t wait. I’m also looking forward to tomorrow and the Cruz de Ferro, which is where you leave the stone, and any stress, that you’ve been carrying with you since the beginning of the Camino.",

          "Watching the sun rise is such an effortlessly beautiful experience. It only takes a matter of minutes, but sometimes it can feel like an eternity. Waking up early took little convincing from everyone the night before. We had gotten used to rising before dawn. It started out as an excuse for doing most of our walking during the hottest parts of the day, but it soon became the natural way of the Camino, at least for our group.",
          "Today we were going to make our way past Cruz de Ferro and the ever growing pile of rocks at its base. Why do some consider this pile more important than any other pile of rocks along The Way? It’s meant to be a place of casting off your burdens. It’s tradition for a person walking the Camino to carry a small rock in their pack, and this rock is meant to symbolize any mental or emotional burdens you might have.",
          "Cruz de Ferro was the first stop of the day at the top of a hill and we arrived just as the sun was striking the cross. The others didn’t know about the tradition with this cross, so I quickly tossed my stone onto the pile and we kept going. I thought I would have felt something, but it didn’t feel as emotional as I was expecting, nor did it feel symbolic. It just felt like tossing a rock onto a pile of other rocks.",
          "We had taken the paved road up to the cross but the trail crossed over the top and down the backside of the hill, and now we started our slow and awkward descent. The terrain was similar to that of the way from Roncesvalles to Zubiri back on day two. I’m glad that I have the knee brace on!",
          "On the way down we came to the town of Manjarín, where an old man lived who claimed to be the last of the Templars. Whether or not his claim is true, he had some neat looking artifacts hanging from the walls, and his home was rather humble in appearance. Well, it had to be since it was built out of stones and partly carved out of the rock.",
          "We marched under a sunny cloudless sky through rolling green hills that slowly transformed into rocky mountains. Breakfast was in a town called El Acebo. We bought breakfast at one place, but decided to eat at the tables in the shade of another. The owner of that second place did not like that since we didn’t buy from them, and promptly kicked us out. So we sat at the tables in the sun of the place that we had purchased the food from.",
          "After another hour and a half of nearly all downhill walking through hills, under bridges, and along streams, we stopped at a town that had a river that you could swim in. The water was ice cold, so I only put my feet in. It was a relaxing break before walking to Ponferrada. Some in our group grabbed beer and ice cream.",
          "The walk into Ponderrada took another hour and a half.  Today was the hottest it’s been so far I think. We were all dying from the heat, even when we were inside buildings. And the Albergue wasn’t much cooler, especially after 5pm. This was going to be a clothes-less night while sleeping, I can feel it already.",
          "We checked in, picked our beds, did the laundry, and went to the super market to get stuff for making dinner. Once all of the chores were done, we decided to take a tour of a restored Templar Castle, which was pretty freaking cool! There wasn’t much to see inside of the castle beyond some props set up with plaques describing life inside the castle, but it was neat being able to freely walk around every nook and cranny.",
          "There was a small cafe just outside the castle where we had a snack. It was too hot to do anything else, so we retreated back to the Albergue for some reading, chatting, and dinner."

          "Another hot day of walking alone, but it ended with a reunion of nearly everyone in our new group, and a swim in the Rio Burbia. I attempted to get an early start with everyone else, but that wasn't going to happen. We made it as far as the castle before I realized I had forgotten my food for the day in the fridge of the Albergue, so I had to turn around and go back.",
          "Luckily, we had only made it as far as the castle before I remembered, but this also meant that I would be walking alone today.",
          "The walk out of the city didn't take too long, and it was mostly along the river. After a steep uphill climb, and a walk through an old park and past a church, I was out in the countryside. But this was short live as the next town over came into view. I powered through it simply because it was too early for breakfast, and I knew I had to try and make up for lost time to catch up with my friends.",
          "As I left the first town behind I snacked on a banana that I had bought the previous day. As I walked along the Calle del Peregrino through the farmlands between the first town and the next I listened to some music while I ate. Shortly thereafter I came upon the next town of Fuentesnuevas. There was nothing of note for me to stop and see here.",
          "Once more unto the rural space of land between towns. Camponaraya, my next port of call on todays journey, had a small juice and cafe stand along the route and I stopped for some orange juice, just so I could use the bathroom. I didn't need to buy any food from here as I still had breakfast items from the grocery store yesterday. I sat for about 30 minutes as I enjoyed my orange juice, ate another banana (living the pilgrim life on the cheap isn't very exciting when it comes to food), and researched places to stay in the last town of the day.",
          "With still no sign of any familiar faces, I set off once more. About an hour later I came upon a town called Cacabellos. It had some very interesting Egyptian-looking wall art on some of the buildings as I passed. Upon arriving I tried to find another \"Green Garden\" spot for some lunch. No such luck. This meant going until the next town of Piero before finding another bathroom, and rest.",
          "In Piero I found a Donativo place to eat my lunch just outside of the city. It was a cute little place that had places to read both inside and out. I got a KAS \"energy\" drink. I chose a spot near the window so that I could watch the road and wait for Crissi and Maddy while I ate my sandwhich that I had rushed back to the Albergue this morning for, but I never saw them. At least the sandwich was good!",
          "Villafranca del Bierzo was the next town, and the stage ender for today. I made it there in about 90 minutes after leaving Piero. I initially started to take the route that went along the road but then I came across a more scenic route which diverted a little bit, but was a lot nicer than worrying about cars.",
          "After a short descent into the outskirts of the city, I checked out the Municipal Albergue, but it was closed when it should have been open. Instead of waiting around for it to open, and risk losing a bed elsewhere, I decided to skip it and go to the next place that I had researched which was Albergue Leo. I fell in love with it as soon as I walked in the front door.",
          "I quickly texted those whose phone numbers I had, and they all met up at my place. I was happy to see everyones lovely face again. After getting stuff for lunch we went to meet up with Louis at a bar, and hopped to a few different places before finding a spot for food.",
          "On the way back to the Albergue we ran into the girls from Texas who we had met several days earlier in Belorado, and who we have seen here and there on the way. They were going back to the river, so we followed them and hung out while doing some swimming, skipping stones, and talking. It was a really good way to spend the afternoon in the heat. I think it got up to 100F today.",
          "We tried to beat the heat and came back to the Albergue to play some cards in order to pass the time. We hit the hay early since we were preparing for our earliest day yet: leaving before 5am."

          "Crissi and I left this town by the river before the sun even thought about rising, and walked the fastest that we've ever walked towards a mountain top. Walking through the dark, in the mountains, early in the morning is amazing. The air is coming alive, the sounds of people aren't yet there, the temperature is cold, and the walking is nearly silent. The only thing illuminated is the small stretch of ground directly in front of you.",
          "Our pace was brisk as we crept through the darkness. On the way through Pereje we passed a pilgrim who was returning to Villafranca at the same pace that we were moving away from it. She must have forgotten something. I can relate.",
          "We continued on, under and over highways, through wooded paths next to rivers, and in front of rock faces that were being held back by cages of wire. Our pre-determined group meeting point was at Trabadelo, and we arrived early, around 7am. Everything was closed, it being Monday morning and all, so we continued on through a series of small cute towns until arriving at Ambasmestas, and had breakfast at a hotel cafe.",
          "On the way to Herrerias, the next stop, we came across a very talkative duck in someones yard. I tried talking to him but he just wasn't having it. Herrerias was the last town before beginning our ascent up the mountain. We decided to continue along once we got there instead of waiting for the others behind us to catch up. The way was via the verys steep road initially, and eventually we came to a dirt path, but this was the steepest portion yet.",
          "Because our friend Maddy was far behind us, we left her a message written in small stones at one of the Camino markers. We found out later on that she never saw it, and instead heard of it from others, which made her happy all the same.",
          "The hike up the mountain was through thick forest which meant we didn't have to worry about the sun beating down on us as we climbed this steep path. We crushed the first part (i.e. walked very fast, and passed many others) and took a brief rest in the town of La Faba. While we were resting near the towns fountain a local farm family decided to let their bulls and donkey out for a stroll through the streets. This isn’t something that you see every day.",
          "Laguna (a town, not the beach) was the next milestone to reach upon this mountain. We also raced up this portion, and I can't remember why, maybe I was in a hurry to be done with the ascent, who knows. We grabbed some cokes and relaxed as we watched others come to the top. After that we went to our destination at O'Cerbreia, which was via a gradually rising trail up from Laguna.",
          "Along the way we crossed over into the next autonmous region: Galicia. We are now officially in the region of Santiago de Compostela.",
          "The views are amazing up here at O'Cerbreia: mountains and rolling hills as far as the eye can see. I simply can't take enough pictures of it. This Albergue, I think the only one up here, was very primitive. The showers lacked curtains, and t he beds were practically stacked on top of each other. And the \"town\" feels like a tourist trap.: two full-blown gift shops, and a museum church.",
          "We grabbed some drinks with everyone after they all arrived. Luis had the hardest journey today: he went up and down three major hills and had to bushwhack the whole way because he took a wrong turn. Dinner was alright, nothing amazing. Hopefully it isn't too stuffy in this Municipal tonight."

          "Galicia is paradise, and we ended up doing nearly two stages in one day just because we wanted to beat the threat of another hot day. Myself and a couple others from our group left together in the darkness. The fog was so dense and thick that our headlamps could barely illuminate the way directly in front of us.",
          "It was a little creepy hiking through the forest with the fog and trees. We stopped by a statue dedicated to the pilgrims at the top of another mountain, it was an eerie sight seeing it rise out of the darkness. Two more towns came and went in the darkness: Hospital de la Condesa and Padornelo. No lights were on, too early for them. Passing cars reminded us where the road was.",
          "As the sun rose the clouds ahead of us became light gray at first, then bright white, and finally pinks followed. The clouds behind us burned as if they were on fire. We made it to Alto do Poio for rest and food. They had a super huge dog that begged us for attention, which I obliged. It laid its massive paw on my arm until I fed it some table scraps, or at least I would have if the owner hadn't called it away.",
          "Crissi and Mauro fell into deep conversation and I fell behind as I stopped to take pictures of the cloud subversion. I saw some of the most beautiful trees, stones, moss and fog landscapes as I descended alone down the mountain.",
          "Amazingly we arrived at Triacastela before noon! Sadly, the three castles here are no more. While we ate breakfast we collectively decided to keep going since there wasn't really anything of interest in this town, and we would have gone crazy staying here having arrived so early in the day. Luckily the others in our group behind us felt the same seeing as they ended up in Sarria as well.",
          "During our breakfast we befriended Eileen from New Zealand, whom spoke near perfect Spansih (even Crissi was impressed), and she walked the rest of the way with us down the mountain. Crissi and Mauro were flying down the second mountain, I couldn't believe how fast they were going. I tried my best to keep up. But halfway down I pulled something, and ended up inflaming a tendon in my ankle.",
          "Luis met up with us at some point as we began the walk in to Sarria. I used my trekking poles as makeshift crutches and hobbled the rest of the way. Before we ascended the stairs into the city, we stopped for a compression sock and pain cream at the pharmacy for my tendon. Big thanks to Crissi for translating and helping to explain what was wrong.",
          "We found a cute Alburgue a stretch of the main road around 5pm, and felt relieved to have a nice place to spend the night. The showers even had privacy! We made another family dinner while watching the Nigeria and Argentina soccer game.",
          "Sarria is the starting point for those who can only take a week of vacation off to do the Camino, which means it's not much farther now."

          "Louis marched on and did two stages in one day, Maddy Cerstin and Isabelle took it easy and stayed at the end of the previous stage, Mauro and Eileen continued on to Gonzar, and Crissi and I stayed in Pontemarion.",
          "I knew to expect this from my research of the Camino, but after experiencing it first-hand I couldn't handle the feelings. To become so intimate with people whom you swear with, suffer with, laugh with, and make memories with. It's something that I've never truly experienced before. I want to go back in time and do the whole thing over again...",
          "I can actually see myself doing this again.",
          "As far as today is concerned, it wasn't too hard of a walk. I took it easy today due to my right ankle tendon issues. It didn't cause any major problems though thanks to the compression sock, which Crissi says is really just a stocking.",
          "We crossed another small mountain on our way out of Sarria. The various forests and small towns that we went through today seemed to pass by in a blur. We stopped for breakfast at a cafe in a small town outside of Morgade. Shortly thereafter it was upon us: the 100 kilometer marker.",
          "Pontemarion was there, ahead of us, a short distance away. We decided to take the not-so-dangerous approach in to the city. The more dangerous approach went down old dirt and brick steps, and the sign warned against doing it only if you were in absolute great shape, which of course I was not.",
          "While eating lunch on the main street Crissi and I ended up deciding to stay in Pontemarion, while Eileen and Mauro would continue on. As soon as they were gone, we convinced ourselves that this was a good decision. As soon as we were settled in though, and relaxing at a bar, we realized that we had made a mistake. We missed them already.",
          "During dinner Crissi and I thought about trying to take a two day trip to Porto, Portugal in order to use up the extra days we'd have since we have been crushing these stages with a passion and figured everyone would be too far ahead or behind us to see them again.",
          "Either way, we will be celebrating the Fourth of July from Fisterra, Spain."

          "When you get the opportunity to walk through Roman ruins after the universe reunites you with a traveling companion, you don't pass it up. It was 6 am when our hosts decided to turn on the lights. Talk about a rude awakening. Everyone was forced to get up and out of bed at the same time, which led to minor amounts of chaos in the dormitory.",
          "The way out of town and back to the Camino was through the same way that we entered it: over the bridge. This town technically wasn't on the original Camino path anymore because they had to move it to higher ground after they flooded the valley a long time ago.",
          "We hiked uphill, passed corn storage houses, and through the charred remains of a forest. 90 minutes later we came to Castromaior after passing through Gonzar. They have a restaurant at this Albergue, which means food, and we were starving!",
          "As we're walking in, a pilgrim is on their way out. It was Eileen! Such pure fate. Crissi and I are happy to be reunited with a travel companion after saying goodbye only just yesterday. We ate our breakfast and hit the trail again.",
          "I noticed that Eileen was walking without her sticks, and I commented on how impressed I was that she was going uphill without them. \"F\\*\\*K!\", she said. Her poles were resting comfortably back at the Albergue we had breakfast at. She was forced to turn around, while Crissi and I marched on. Why we didn't turn back with her, I do not know. A few moments later and we were walking uphill again.",
          "Just outside of Castromaior were the ruins of a Roman encampment. I couldn't pass up this opportunity to actually walk through history, to be able to reach out and touch it. You can see where the fires were, the kitchens, and even the bathrooms. You just don't get a chance like this back home in the States with historical landmarks: they're usually roped off.",
          "Afterwards we waited for Eileen at a restaurant outside of Hospital Alta da Cruz. After she arrived we got back on the trail. Palas de Red was the next big city, and the chance for a good solid lunch, during which we unanimously decided to \"turn on Beast Mode\" and push for Melide, about 14 kilometers away.",
          "It was a hard walk, but we had a great time and did plenty of talking. We were nearly dead when we arrived in the outskirts of Melide though. Upon reaching the bridge into town, we ran into Mauro placing a hand written note on the bridge telling us to meet him in town. It was so darn cute.",
          "Now we're all together again! We found a great place to stay with a nice green backyard. When we were heading out to dinner I ran in to Sam! I'm glad to see that he is finishing the Camino, 40 pound backpack and all.",
          "Melide is well known for its Pulpo a la Gallega, which is boiled octopus served with olive oil, paprika, bread, and white wine in a bowl. We didn't shy away from having some.",

Maybe it was fitting that the start of the day would be filled with rain.",

It felt like we were all on autopilot: follow the arrows, one foot in front of the other, keep going until you see a big church. Before entering the plaza of the cathedral, we passed through the old part of the city. As is tradition, since Galicia is very Celtic in its roots and culture, we were played into the plaza by bagpipes in the tunnel before entering.",

After a emotional day in Santiago, we were ready to get back on The Way, and head to Finisterre and the end of the world. The streets were mostly empty this morning. As we walked through the plaza to head out of the city we saw several pilgrims beginning to arrive.",
          "It was Monday, July 2nd, and we were back in our element. I stole one last look at the cathedral of Santiago before we headed into the wilderness. We were surrounded by forests as we began our ascent up the hills surrounding the city. It would be a mostly uphill hike today. And there was no shortage of small hamlets and villages to walk through.",

          "We mostly marched straight through to Ponte Maceira which sat on top of a river called Río Tambre. There was a medieval bridge here which was pretty cool to walk around. In Finesterre you can get another certificate for completing the walk from Santiago to there, but this meant getting more stamps again, and the place where we would be getting our first stamp was a random restaurant on the river. The restaurant wouldn't open for another 45 minutes, and it was the only authorized place in town who could give the stamp, so we explored the bridge and riverbed.",
          "When they finally opened, we felt guilty for making them hurry while we waited outside, so we ordered some food. Bad idea. It was a fish empanada from the night before. Yuck. We didn't waste much time setting out as soon as we had one bite.",
          "Negreira was our stop for today, and it was all uphill. But it was filled with beautiful scenery and views as we ascended. Arrival in town was fast, and we quickly decided upon an Albergue above a bar. We had a very, very, cheap lunch: a full burger, fries, and beer for less than 5 euros in a bar down the street.",
          "There wasn't much to do in this town at first glance. We played some cards back at the Alburgue before deciding to sleep off the walking from today before dinner. I woke up to find Crissi and Mauro were gone, so I took a solo walk around town to see what it had to offer. Tons of clothing shops, and grocery stores, which surprised me because we've seen towns of the same size with less.",
          "I saw my friends sitting on a bench after turning around at the end of a street, and convinced them to get a 3-pack of ice cream bars with me. Best decision ever. We found a cute spot for dinner and drinks. It felt very chic, like an American cafe, and the dinner was superb. We watched the soccer game, partly because we had nothing else to do. So far these towns after Santiago felt less Camino-ish.",
          "It would be an early night today. It felt good to get back to walking after taking a day off. I'm eager to get to the end, but I also want it to take forever so that this never ends."

          "I walked alone in the rain for most of the day, which didn't bother me at all. It was very calming, and put me in a great mood. Day four of rain in the morning, and probably the third day on the entire Camino with a full day of rain. As long as my shoes stay dry, I'm a happy camper. The goal for today was Santa Mariña, with was about 25 kilometers away. This was because Crissi and I were in no rush to finish since we now knew that we would have time at the end.",
          "Old houses surrounded us as we left, and the low hanging clouds, and misting rain, put me in the finest of moods as I walked. The others sped up while talking, and I fell behind once more. I took as many opportunities as possible to wander onto peoples property, trying to take good pictures, and talk to the dogs. The dogs were unresponsive, and couldn't give two shits about me, but the pictures, I think, turned out well.",
          "Sheep greeted me (really they just ignored me and kept eating that grass) as I came to A Peña two hours later. There was a cafe up the stairs, and I found Mauro and Crissi waiting for me at the bottom of them. Another Pilgrim was inside finishing up and about to head back out on the path. I stole (more like asked if I could have) his leftover Spanish Tortilla. Nearly half of it was left, waiting to be eaten. Suddenly I realized that I would have never done something like this back home, but it felt like a no-brainer since it would go to waste. We have become scavengers.",
          "We continued on through the rain for another two and a half hours until arriving in Santa Mariña. After scoping out the places to stay, and getting some cokes, we (more like I) decided that we should keep going. This town felt as boring as the last, was a fraction of the size, and the air contained the constant smell of cow feces. This is a smell I will be happy to get away from once we leave the farmlands of Galicia, and will be happy to never have to smell again.",
          "I put in the headphones, turned on shuffle mode, and cranked up the music for the next two hours of rainy walking towards Olveiroa. This time it was me who pulled ahead and the others fell behind. I don't know when this exactly happened but I realized that they were far behind me when I came to Mallón and decided to pause and let them catch up. I Grabbed some organce juice at the bar, and sat outside waiting. They showed up, separately, 15 minutes later, so they weren't too far behind me.",
          "Beers were ordered, and we hung out for a short break. The Texans passed us again, said they were heading to Olveiroa. The three of us decided to follow them after our break and knock out the full stage today. We got in to town around 3pm. With money on our minds, we checked out the cheaper Albergue but it wasn’t that great, so we ended up going to the more expensive one.",
          "I met up with Lauren and Hailey (the Texans) at the restaurant next to the Albergue later in the evening. We played some card games while watching football. Dinner was so-so, and we didn’t really do much other than hang out at the bar watching sports. We're all planning on heading for the ocean towns of Cee and Corcubòn tomorrow."

          "Spoiler alert: we decided to combine multiple stages today and finish the Camino all together. It was a truly magical experience arriving at the 0 km marker with the sun coming out from behind the clouds. I sat and reflected for nearly an hour on the rocks staring out at the ocean.",
          "Oh my God, the sunrise this morning was so epic. In fact, the whole morning hike out of Olveiroa to Hospital (so many towns on the Camino with this name) was amazing. Breakfast today was served up at a cute cafe in Hospital.  We took a good long break here.",
          "Shortly after leaving, we came to a decision. To the left: Fisterra, and to the right: Muxia. I know where I was going, so it was a no brainer. Mauro had to decide which way he wanted to go since he had less time than us to finish. He ended up deciding to come with us.",
          "No more towns for a while, back to hiking through the wilderness. As we gained ground, and made our way up the hill, we were able to grab our first views of the ocean, and our destination at Cee / Corcubión. A couple of hours later the mist returned to us. We also picked up a new walking companion halfway through: Anna from Hungary.",
          "There it is, our first glimpse of the ocean! We walked through Cee and headed for Corcubión. The walk around the bay was pleasant, even if we did get lost halfway through and had to make our own alternative Camino to get back on track. Lunch was served via sandwiches from yesterday on the waters edge. We were not looking forward to this next part. It was time to say goodbye, for the last time, again. We had reached our stage ender for the day, but the others needed to keep going.",
          "We walked with them to the towns edge before the path turned away from a low stone wall and up into the hills once more. We said goodbye, and watched them disappear into the trees. As Crissi and I walked back into town to find a place to stay something came over us, something clicked in our minds. Crissi and I looked at eachother at the exact same moment , and we said it at the same time: we should keep going and catch up with them. We returned to the spot where we had said our goodbyes and continued walking.",
          "It only took us about an hour of walking before we came to the town of Estorde and wanted to explore this amazing beach off to our left. It looked like private property, and was set behind a fancy hotel. As soon as we got onto the sand, we saw a figure walking in the distance along the waters edge. I recognized the uniquely brown sweater that they were wearing, but I didn't want to get my hopes up. Sure enough, it was Anna!",
          "We rested here for no good reason, other than to get coffee, pop, and enjoy the beach at the hotels restaruant. An hour later we would have our first views of Fisterra. Seeing it from The Way for the first time was amazing. We didn't waste any time walking along this stretch of water-front trail in order to get to town and to the end.",
          "As we arrived in to town, and began to the walk to The Lighthouse, the sun came out of hiding and brightened the world around us. It was perfect timing. It was a truly magical experience arriving at the 0 km marker. Here it was, the official end of the Camino. I was overcome with emotion, and the locals/visitors let us take our time taking pictures at it.",
          "We walked up to and around The Lighthouse. Behind it a cliff dropped away to the ocean far, far, below. Along the way down were several rocks and places to sit. We all claimed a spot, and just sat there in the silence, staring at the ocean. I must have sat there for nearly an hour on the rocks. I reflected upon everything that had brought me to this point. I also let my mind go blank and just stare in awe and wonder.",
          "This was it. The end. The true end. The end of the world.",
          "Mauro had found us while we were on the rocks, and needless to say he was happy to see us again. We left the ocean around 5:30 pm and started to walk back in to town. Places would be filling up fast. The municipal Albergue was already full, so we kept checking out other places. Each and every one was full.",
          "Before we parted ways after re-entering town, Anna had told us about this Hungarian Albergue that she booked a room at. Out of options, we went there. They had beds available, and ended up putting us in the same room as her.",
          "At some point we found Cerstin, I can't remember when or how, but she was there!",
          "We grabbed dinner with the Texans around 7pm at a fish restaurant, and then headed for the “hippy” beach that our Albergue host had told us about. It was a great time hanging out in the water and walking along the beach with everyone. We saw dolphins in the ocean!",
          "Words cannot express what this journey has meant to me. I can tell you about the friends, places, and pain, but you can never truly fully know it unless you go and experience it for yourself.",
          "We said our real, truthful, final goodbyes to everyone on the morning of July 5th at the bus stop in Fisterra. They took the earlier buses back to Santiago, then on to the airport, and their flights back to their homes. I'm thankful to have been able to meet so many amazing human beings.",
          "Crissi and I checked out of the Hungarian Albergue. We walked along the beach for a couple of hours, collecting numerous sea shells, and then headed for the bus back to Santiago.",
          "We spent our final day together walking around the city, seeing the pilgrim museum, going back to the same place for dinner that we had been to when we previously came here, and seeing some other landmarks that we had missed the first time. We also went clothes/gift shopping for ourselves.",
          "At night we returned to the plaza, and sat there for nearly an hour staring at the place as the sun set. This was the place we had dreamt of reaching, and had finally arrived at. This was our last chance to say goodbye to the Cathedral. We returned to our place to finish packing up, and to go to bed.",
          "Back in Belorado, Crissi had left early in the morning before I woke up without saying goodbye. Now, as fate would have it, it's the same again. She had to leave earlier than me in order to catch a train to Madrid, before I would be waking to walk to the bus for the airport. We said goodbye at night, one final hug, an expression of thanks, and promised to see each other back in the states.",
          "I probably wouldn't be seeing my closest Camino friend/family again, at least not for a long time, and I was very sad. On the morning of July 7th, 2018 I packed up my bag for the last time, left the Albergue alone and in the dark, boarded a bus, and headed for the airport for my return back to America.",
          "I'll see you again someday St. James."
