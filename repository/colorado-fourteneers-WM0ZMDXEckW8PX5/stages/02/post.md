One day after completing my very first 14'er, and I was waking up once again
during the pre-dawn hours to set out to conquer another mountain peak. This
one was advertised as being not as long or as rough as Mt. Elbert, but knowing that
I could do the biggest and baddest of the easier 14'ers made me feel more
confident about this one, but we shall see...

I parked on the road after driving for two and half hours and listening to that
80's retro station. The trailhead started right from the edge of the road, so
there was no official parking lot for this one. It was 4:30 am in the morning.

Most of the trail in the woods was switchbacks, and a lot of the portions had
stairs carved out of the rock. This made it somewhat easy to manage but that
still meant doing a lot of stair climbing, especially after being sore and tired
from yesterdays hike.

There was a good amount of people on the trail this morning, and evenly spaced
so that I was still hiking solo but could still the light from their headlamps.

By 6:00 am I was above the trees, and just in time. There was a beautiful
sunrise and I am glad I got started as early as I did in order to be able to
witness it.

Tons of large cairns marked the trail and I always love a good cairn; it makes
for a good element in a photo. Most of the trail from the trailhead to just
below the summit was rock-cut stairs, with the same amount of rise between steps
as a staircase in a home would be, which actually ended up being pretty nice
and made the ascent predictable in terms of pace.

I saw a lot of cute little critters that looked like tiny squirrels called
Pikas. They were chirping to eachother as they scurried over and under
rocks looking for food.

At long last I could see the summit, and the singular flase summit in front of it.
Once on the ridge ot the summit the trail transitioned from stairs to scree-filled
paths. There were still some snow patches here and there on the sides of the
trail. I made the summit by 8:00 am! Such a faster time than Mt. Elbert by nearly
two hours.

As I stood there taking in the view and snapping photos of the surrounding area
people asked if I could take their picture for them, which was a good icebreaker!
I ended up chatting with a bunch of people, and was even offered a free beer. I
spent a good 30-45 minutes up there, and even had cell reception. Soon it would
be time to start heading back down though.

Me and one other person left at the same time, and they helped set a good pace
while going down. At one point they were practically flying over the rocks, and
I matched their style. It ended up being surprisingly easy given how well the
trail itself was maintained. I was worried about my knees, but the braces did
their job. By 1:00 pm I was back down at the car.

This was such an amazing experience with an easy hike up, a great group of fun
and social people, and of course a free beer. It really helped to salvage the
whole trip and turn it into a really positive experience. I would most
definitely be coming back for more next year.
