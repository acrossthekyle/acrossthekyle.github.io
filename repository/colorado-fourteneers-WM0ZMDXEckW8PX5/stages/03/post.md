For my second year hiking Colorado's 14'ers, I decided to camp near the trailheads. This way, I could wake up at 4:00 am instead of 1:00 am and drive three hours. Just ten minutes to the start felt like a luxury after last year's early mornings.

My first peak of the trip was La Plata Peak, named after the area's numerous silver mines. The trail wasn't particularly long, but it was technically more challenging than the hikes I completed the previous year. The trails are classified from 1 to 5, with 1 being the easiest. Mt. Elbert and the second 14'er I climbed last year were 1's, while La Plata rated as a 2.

I set up a wild camp about a mile and a half from the trailhead. I was completely alone, surrounded by silence except for the sound of a nearby river. Sleeping on a slight incline made the night restless, but I woke around 3:30 am, packed up, and drove the short distance to the trailhead. I cooked a quick breakfast in the trunk of my rental SUV, noticing about ten other cars but few hikers on the trail.

The climb started with two hours through thick forest before opening to a rocky wall crisscrossed with switchbacks. I didn't try to reach the sunrise point, but the morning light painted the surrounding peaks pink, making them look snow-covered even in early September. Emerging above the trees, I could see neighboring peaks and began hiking a saddle ridge toward the summit, spotting strange alpine plants and hidden patches of snow. Far below, a small mountain lake shimmered, a beautiful contrast against the rocky landscape.

I reached the summit around noon after about six hours on the trail. It was more crowded than I expected, with hikers whose cars I had seen in the parking lot. I lingered briefly to eat and take photos, but like on Mt. Elbert, social interaction was limited, so I headed back down. The descent took longer than planned when I ran out of water for nearly two hours before reaching a river. Luckily, I realized I had my filter the whole time and could safely drink. I ended the day with a fresh change of clothes, a quick stop at a larger river to refill, and a restful night at a last-minute campground.

Camping close to the trailhead made this experience feel more relaxed than my previous Colorado hikes. Despite the technical challenges of La Plata Peak, the combination of solitude, alpine scenery, and personal accomplishment made it a memorable adventure. I left the mountains feeling energized and ready for the next peak.
