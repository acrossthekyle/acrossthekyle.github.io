  "description": [
    "Peak-bagging is the activity of hiking to the summits of a list of mountains, often defined by specific criteria like altitude or location, and then checking them off as completed. For the Rocky Mountains in Colorado, that criteria is hiking to peaks above 14,000 feet in elevation. It's an awe-inspiring experience offering unparalleled views. Reaching the summit is a moment of profound triumph, a feeling of being on top of the world.",
    "These are the summits I have completed so far, %length% in total, with most of them being Class 1 and 2 routes. My favorite so far was Quandary Peak."
