    "I returned to South America for another international adventure, this time including Lollapalooza, discovering a passion for the wilderness by hiking into the Andes mountains in search of glaciers, and heading down to Patagonia where I first learned about backpacking while walking underneath the granite spires called Torres del Paine."
