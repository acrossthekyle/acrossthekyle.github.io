  "description": [
    "From pyramids, tombs, and temples, to soaring overhead in a hot air balloon ride, we tried to do it all on this once-in-a-lifetime vacation from December 2022 to January 2023. Egypt is an ancient place, full of history, and busy streets. We knew to expect the unexpected, but we weren't prepared for how amazing the historical landmarks were, or how different the culture was.",
    "Egypt is an amazing place if you only consider the historical things. The way the locals treat foriegners leaves something to be desired. If we ever came back we would definitely do it through a service that would plan everything for us, and rely on tour guides for everything."
