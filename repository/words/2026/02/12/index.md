Premise: a genetic defect has caused the entire human population to go blind for generations, but sight is slowly returning to the world.

An interesting concept, and it started out strong, but like most stories that are stretched across 8+ episodes in a single season, and even across multiple seasons, it lost it's strength. I finally finished watching it the other day after forcing myself to do so, just for the sake of being a completionist.

Like I said, it started strong with an interesting concept, but it lost me along the way. I did appreciate the close-quarters fighting style though, and the way they made a world without sight work for the masses.
