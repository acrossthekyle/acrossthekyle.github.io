Premise: a genetic defect has caused the entire human population to go blind for generations, but sight is slowly returning to the world.

An interesting concept, but like most shows focused on a single story across multiple episodes, and seasons, it lost its strength. I finally finished watching it the other day, just for the sake of being a completionist.

It started strong with the aforementioned unique concept, but it lost me along the way. Although it wasn't the best show ever, I did appreciate the close-quarters fighting style, and the world they created.
