I've redesigned this website more times than I can count, with each iteration feeling a bit...off. So, I decided to try something different.

Rather than working myself up into a design frenzy trying to fill the entire screen with an evenly-spaced layout while at the same time wondering if I'm using the correct amount of negative space, or animating the necessary elements (and of course agonizing over multiple screen sizes), I decided to keep this design simple, and light.

Less is more.
