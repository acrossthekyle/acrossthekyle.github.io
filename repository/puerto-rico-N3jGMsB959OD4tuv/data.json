    "We decided to book a last minute trip to Puerto Rico in order to escape the lingering winter cold in Chicago, and spent a few days exploring parts of the island from the beaches to the jungle to the forts. Sadly the damage from the recently destructive hurricane was still visible in many areas of San Juan."
