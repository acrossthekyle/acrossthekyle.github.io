We woke from a less-than-stellar night of sleep, ready to take on the day after a breakfast of cereal with warm milk, scrambled eggs, bread with Nutella, and coffee (which somehow still didn't feel like enough).

The hike began with a brutal three miles of steep uphill. We were panting with every step until a brief rest where a kind Frenchman checked on us: "Se va? You ok?". After that initial ascent, the trail flattened a bit through the woods, leading down to a picturesque suspension bridge before climbing up again. The scenery was lovely, definitely channeling the spirit of "Climb every mountain".

Then came the main event: the Col de Tricot. Hours of relentless uphill with zero shade had us working overtime all over again. The wind at the top was a relief though, perfect for a much-needed lunch. The packed sandwich from the gite was brie, tomato, and lettuce on a baguette. It was lifesaving, even if the accompanying orange was a messy affair.

The descent was another challenge: 1 hour and 10 minutes of switchbacks that tormented our toes. We hit Miage at the bottom and we wished we were staying there. A short rest and water break, then another 35 minutes up to our night's lodging, Auberge le Truc.

Auberge le Truc is rustic. Limited water, no showers, and a very interesting (broken) conveyor belt pit toilet. The simple pleasure of the constant, rhythmic sound of cowbells made up for the lack of amenities.

Dinner was an experience: three Brits (who support Trump, so probably not our new best friends) joined our table. The meal itself started strong with great vegetable soup, followed by a funky but good combination of pasta with red sauce, a cheese omelette, cheese, and crème brûlée. Seriously loving the salt in everything over here!

Tonight's accomodation is a 28-person bunk bed room. We've snagged the top bunks by the door and are all packed and ready for an early departure tomorrow morning. Another day, another adventure down!
