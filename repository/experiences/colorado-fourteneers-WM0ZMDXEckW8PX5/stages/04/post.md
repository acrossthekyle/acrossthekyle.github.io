For the second hike of my Colorado trip, I chose an easier summit, Mt. Bierstadt, and planned a later start at 6:00 am since I had to drive about an hour from my campground. This class 1 route involved some scrambling over boulders near the summit, but nothing too challenging. One of the most striking features of this 14'er was the massive paved parking lot, which was already overflowing by the time I arrived.

The trail was crowded, but that's to be expected for a peak so close to a major city with easy access. The first hour of the hike was pleasantly flat, winding through prairies dotted with bushes, small lakes, and streams. A boardwalk at the start made crossing streams simple while protecting the local vegetation. I loved this section and paused often to take photos of the idyllic landscape.

Once I reached the base of the mountain, the trail turned into switchbacks leading to the boulder-strewn top. With total elevation gain in the 2,000-foot range, I reached the summit by 10:30 am. It was a surprisingly quick and easy climb compared to some of the other peaks I had tackled.

At the top, I met a few fellow hikers and enjoyed the views, though the summit quickly filled with more people arriving. The descent required minor scrambling and some wayfinding, but following other hikers made it straightforward. The trail was fast and easy, a relief as the temperature started rising.

Mt. Bierstadt offered a very different experience from my other hikes. The combination of open prairie, alpine lakes, boulder scrambling, and wide-open skies made it a beautiful and accessible day hike. I left feeling refreshed and grateful for the simpler side of Colorado's 14'er adventures.
