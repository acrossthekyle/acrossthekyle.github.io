I arrived on the island of Corsica yesterday, ready to start a long-awaited trek. My starting point was Calenzana, where I grabbed a quick dinner with a few other hikers staying at the same gîte. The night that followed was restless, filled with anticipation for the early morning start. I could hardly wait to return to the mountains and immerse myself in the rugged beauty that Corsica promised.

The first day almost had me quitting. The windows had been left open all night to let in a breeze, which helped with the mid-summer heat, but I still didn't sleep well. With little rest, I packed up my gear and had a simple breakfast of yogurt with cereal, a banana, and some bread and butter I had bought the day before. By 6:30 a.m., I was on the trail.

The ascent began immediately, and the trail wasted no time testing me. Although the elevation wasn't extreme, I struggled to catch my breath on the switchbacks. My lack of training beyond walking my dog Dax and an occasional treadmill workout became painfully obvious. My Garmin watch confirmed it: my heart rate stayed firmly in the endurance zone, and I took breaks at every corner just to recover. Despite the challenge, I paused constantly to take photos of the incredible surroundings.

After two and a half hours, I reached a col and enjoyed a stretch of downhill and level trail. The respite was brief, however, as the path soon rose again, this time introducing scrambling and climbing over rocks. I hadn't stretched that morning, and my muscles certainly let me know it. Eventually, the trail opened to a bald section of the mountain, offering a first glimpse of the refuge where I would spend the night. The remaining ups and downs were manageable, and soon I arrived at the refuge and pitched my tent. The site was exposed with no shade or vegetation, a typical setup for this part of the trail.

The refuge was busy, which was exciting because it meant more opportunities to meet fellow hikers. Little lizards scurried about everywhere, and three cows wandered through the camping area, hopefully avoiding my tent. Dinner was a highlight, shared with hikers from Germany, the Netherlands, and Belgium. By the end of the evening, we had formed a small group that would walk and camp together for the next nine days, marking the beginning of an unforgettable adventure.
