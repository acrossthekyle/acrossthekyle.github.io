Day seven started with a chilly morning that hinted at the long day ahead. The trail out of the refuge led us through boggy ground before beginning the climb toward a distant mountain ridge. The sun was still rising, leaving the trail in shadow as we carefully navigated shrubs and rocks. At one point we took a wrong turn and had to backtrack, but eventually we reached the top after about two hours. The stony summit offered a well-earned break, with a dizzying drop stretching out below us.

The descent to the next ridge was more manageable, though some sections required scooting down on our butts, and chains helped us navigate the trickier spots. We chose the lower route over the upper section, avoiding sharp, jagged rocks. From there, the trail ran along the mountainside, windy and cold, as we followed the contours of the ridge.

After about an hour and a half, the flat trail ended and it was time for another ascent, this time to a snow-patched area with icy waters. I dunked my feet into the freezing water to refresh them, careful not to go in fully as the water was a bit murky. Refreshed, I continued toward the next refuge for the night, descending steep switchbacks and slippery rocks along the way.

The campsite promised another challenging night for tents, as the ground was hard-packed and required rocks to hold down stakes. Despite that, the refuge itself offered some much-needed comforts, including sundaes, eggs, and fries for lunch. I enjoyed a plate piled high, along with a soda and a sundae, without a hint of guilt.

Dinner was served with pre-assigned seating, so our group was split up, but the conversation was lively nonetheless. Fellow hikers were amazed that I had come all the way from Chicago just to take on this trek. Afterward, we played cards together, and everyone is looking forward to tomorrow's refuge, which reportedly serves amazing lasagna. It was another day filled with adventure, breathtaking views, and moments of camaraderie on the trail.
