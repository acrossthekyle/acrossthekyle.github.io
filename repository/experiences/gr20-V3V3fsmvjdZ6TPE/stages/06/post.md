I started the day with breakfast while watching the sun rise over the mountains, and by 7:00 am we were on the trail. The first part of the hike was a gentle introduction, winding through open woods with plenty of clearings that offered beautiful views of the surrounding peaks. The path was mostly flat for nearly three miles, and even the sections that required some ascending were easy enough to enjoy without feeling strained.

Once we reached the upper portion of the trail, the terrain became more exposed and rocky. The path zig-zagged across rugged hills and through rocky columns, eventually giving way to lush green hills. From the summits, we caught our first glimpse of Lac de Nino, a mountain lake that looked pristine from above.

As we descended toward the lake, we realized it was surrounded by a bog. Walking across required caution to avoid stepping on soft spots, and some areas already had large holes exposing the water beneath. We didn't swim in the lake, but we paused on some boulders at its edge for a quick break before continuing on the trail, which thankfully remained flat for several miles. The white stone path cut a clear line through the bright green grasses of the surrounding plains, making the walk both easy and scenic.

We stopped at the next Bergerie for a short break, tackling some incredibly hard bread and washing it down with Orangina. From there, we crossed open plains toward Refuge de Manganu, arriving mid-afternoon. The campsite was lively, and we noticed cows wandering through the area and nudging tents with their horns. We rigged up a makeshift fence with rope and rocks to keep them at bay.

Next to the refuge, a river flowed with wide, flat areas perfect for cooling off, so we spent some time relaxing in the water. Dinner at the refuge was simple but satisfying: pasta with red sauce, bread, a small portion of meat, and dessert. As the sun set, it cast a warm, golden glow over the eating area, creating a cozy atmosphere that made for a perfect end to another day on the trail.
