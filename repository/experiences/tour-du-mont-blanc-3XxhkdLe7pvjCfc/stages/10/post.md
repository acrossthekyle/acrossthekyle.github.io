Everyone warned me about the ladders, claiming they were the scariest part of the trip, but with the alternate route closed due to a landslide, there was no avoiding them. The morning sun peeked over the mountains as we left Tré-le-Champ and entered the woods. We steadily climbed, navigating tree roots and rocky outcroppings, including the massive Aiguillete d'Argentière monolith, a rock the size of a two-story house that had long ago fallen from the mountain's peak.

Along the trail, we paused at a perfect window in the rocks, framed by trees, to watch the sun's rays play over Mont Blanc in the distance. Even wildlife joined the spectacle as an Ibex leapt gracefully from rock to rock, seemingly unconcerned by our presence. Soon, we reached the ladders. Contrary to the stories, they weren't frightening, just metal rungs helping us navigate the steeper terrain, though the line of hikers waiting for photos turned it into a social affair.

After the ladders, the mountains opened up to a series of lakes, each more stunning than the last. Lac Blanc, with its turquoise waters reflecting Mont Blanc itself, was breathtaking. I braved a frigid swim, the icy water like a thousand needles on my skin, and couldn't resist a second dip. Coffee brewed nearby while we soaked in the sun and let our gear dry, a perfect Alpine pause before continuing.

By late afternoon, we arrived at Refuge de l'Flegère, only to witness an unexpected spectacle: a fire across the valley. Emergency crews in helicopters tirelessly ferried water from a nearby reservoir to douse the blaze. Watching the precise, almost choreographed effort left me in awe of both the firefighters and the machinery.

The evening brought a sense of calm and camaraderie. We played card games, shared dinner with fellow Israeli hikers, and stepped outside later to gaze at the night sky. The Milky Way stretched overhead, only slightly dimmed by the sparkling lights of Chamonix in the valley below. A perfect end to a day of adventure, awe, and Alpine beauty.
