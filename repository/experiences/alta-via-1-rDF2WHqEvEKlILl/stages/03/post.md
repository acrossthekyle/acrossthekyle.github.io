Breakfast at the rifugio set the tone for another beautiful day on the Alta Via 1. I took a final stroll around the grounds before packing up, enjoying the overcast sky that still allowed bright sunlight to filter through. The trail led us away from the lake and into the woods, quickly gaining elevation until we emerged above the trees. From there, rolling green hills dotted with rocks stretched as far as the eye could see, and the beginnings of a cloud inversion added a magical touch to the landscape.

Our group of six kept a steady pace through the morning. Alongside my friend Cerstin were two mother-daughter pairs from the States. While most of us moved together, one of the mother-daughter duos picked up the pace during a steep ascent, leaving the rest of us to enjoy the scenery at a slightly slower tempo. The trail passed lakes, empty cattle pens, and rivers while winding around massive boulders. We even discovered a cave in the rock face, though it proved unremarkable.

As the day progressed, we reached the edge of a forested valley flanked by massive walls of rock. Before descending, we had to climb up the left side of the valley, huffing and puffing for about an hour until snow patches came into view. At the top, the trail stretched out below us in steep switchbacks that led toward a lake. From our vantage point, the view was spectacular, revealing the path we would follow the next day.

The descent brought us closer to the lake, where a true wall of rock dominated the landscape. We took a well-deserved break to dip our feet in the water and snap photos, sharing the space with a lively group of schoolchildren on a field trip. Nearby stone ruins added a touch of history, and the trail led past a wide river that offered fresh water before we finally approached Rifugio Scotoni. World War II barracks and old ammunition depots stood as silent reminders of the past, contrasting with the natural beauty around us.

Rifugio Scotoni proved to be a cozy and welcoming stop, with comfortable rooms, a view of the surrounding valley, and a patio perfect for dinner. Clouds and rain rolled in during the late afternoon, giving everyone a reason to relax and nap. As night fell, we enjoyed beers on the patio while watching the stars emerge above the mountains, a perfect end to a day filled with breathtaking scenery and memorable experiences.
