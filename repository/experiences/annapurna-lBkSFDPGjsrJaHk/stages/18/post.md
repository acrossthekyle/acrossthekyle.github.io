The last day of my Himalayan adventure was short but peaceful. I set off just after breakfast, following a mostly downhill trail toward a jeep station that would take me back to Pokhara. Before leaving, I took a moment to enjoy the sunrise from my small private balcony, a quiet farewell to the mountains.

The trail was nearly empty today, passing through small clusters of teahouses and bright green scenery. A few sections required walking on the road, but thankfully no vehicles appeared. The area was dotted with beautiful trees, making the final stretch feel calm and serene.

I moved quickly, eager to reach my hostel and enjoy a long-awaited hot shower. The night before, I had booked a nicer hostel in Pokhara that also offered excursions such as paragliding, adding a touch of excitement to the end of the trip.

The jeep station was simple, with shaded benches and cold drinks while waiting. My ride down the mountain was in two parts: the first on a bumpy dirt road where we paused briefly for a landslide to be cleared, and the second on smoother, paved roads after a transfer to a pre-paid taxi. The journey reminded me how rugged yet beautiful the Himalayas can be.

As I settled back in Pokhara, I reflected on the journey. I met incredible people, witnessed breathtaking landscapes, and experienced moments of both challenge and awe, including a near-death scare. This trek will always remain one of my favorite adventures, and I hope someday to return for another unforgettable Himalayan experience, perhaps even the Everest Basecamp trek.
