The big day had finally arrived: crossing Thorong La Pass and stepping into the second half of the circuit. While we would lose more elevation than we gained, the challenge of the day was unmistakable. We ate breakfast quickly, eager and a little anxious to get moving.

The climb from Thorong Phedi to the pass was slow and deliberate. The trail was crowded, and starting at nearly 15,000 feet meant frequent stops just to catch our breath. It became a simple rhythm of putting one foot in front of the other. After three and a half hours of steady effort, we finally reached the pass.

The sense of accomplishment was overwhelming. We dropped our packs and soaked in the moment, crouching together for photos beside the sign marking the highest point of the trek. Standing back up brought instant dizziness and light-headedness, a sharp reminder of how thin the air was. Even small movements left us winded, and it was clear this was not a place to linger too long.

Eventually, we began the long descent toward Muktinath. The trail down felt fast and almost freeing after the slow climb, and we moved quickly, stopping once at a refuge for refreshments. After about three hours, the landscape opened up and we arrived in Muktinath.

Muktinath felt like a small city compared to where we had been, full of shops, places to stay, and life. We checked into a spot called Bob Marleys, which felt luxurious after days on the trail. Hot showers, comfortable beds, and one of the best meals of the trek awaited us. My first-ever pasta carbonara sealed the day as one I will never forget.
