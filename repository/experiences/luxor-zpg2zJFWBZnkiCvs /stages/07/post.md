Unlike the other temples we visited, this one seemed to literally grow out of the landscape instead of resting on top of it. Its three massive limestone terraces are carved directly into the face of the cliffs, creating a symmetrical silhouette.

This was also probably the busiest temple that we visited. Loads of tour buses were lined up in front of it, ruining an otherwise great view of the temple. We didn't spend much time at this one. While it was cool to visit it wasn't as impressive as the other temples.
