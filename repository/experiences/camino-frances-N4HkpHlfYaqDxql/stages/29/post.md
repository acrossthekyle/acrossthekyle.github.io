I could hardly believe that we had finally reached Santiago. Our destination, which had always seemed so far away, was now in front of us after so many days and miles of walking. The morning began with a torrential downpour that felt like a fan blasting on my face. Maybe it was fitting that the start of our final day would be accompanied by such heavy rain.

Fortunately, the rain eased as we walked. Most of the morning was spent moving through wet fields, shaded forests, and past longhorn oxen. We stopped briefly at Monte de Gozo to see the monument and catch our first glimpse of the cathedral towers in the distance. With each step into the city, the crowd of fellow pilgrims grew, all following the yellow arrows in silent determination toward the plaza. Bagpipes welcomed us through the old city tunnel, a Celtic tradition that added a mystical quality to our entrance.

Arriving in the plaza, I stood before the cathedral in disbelief. After so many days and miles, this was it. We took photos, shared hugs, and then collected our Compostelas, the official certificates marking the completion of the Camino. The reality sank in: the journey was over. There would be no walking tomorrow, just rest and time to explore the city.

We attended the Pilgrim Mass, which was entirely in Spanish, and watched the enormous incense burner swing dramatically over the congregation. Later, we celebrated at a local tapas restaurant with Crissi, Cerstin, Mauro, and Bianca, the original group from Hontanas. It felt strange not to worry about waking up early for another day on the trail.

As night fell, Crissi, Mauro, and I returned to the cathedral. Its grandeur in the quiet of evening was overwhelming. Standing there, reflecting on the journey, I nearly felt tears welling up. I hugged Crissi tightly and thanked her simply: for the companionship, support, laughter, and shared experiences. Without her, this incredible journey would not have been possible.

Tomorrow we will head to Finisterre, to see the zero mile marker and continue our small postscript to the Camino. But tonight, I allowed myself to simply stand in awe, grateful for every step that led me here.
