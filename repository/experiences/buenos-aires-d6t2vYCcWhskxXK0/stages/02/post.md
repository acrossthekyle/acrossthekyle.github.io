Experiencing Lollapalooza was the absolute highlight of my trip to Buenos Aires.

Since the venue is actually at a racetrack in San Isidro (a neighborhood north of the city center), getting there required a bit of planning. We stuck to the common mode of transportation: the train. It was packed. We got off at San Isidro Station, which is just a 15 minute walk to the racetrack entrance.

As a tourist I couldn't have my wristband mailed abroad, so we had to go to Will Call. Luckily there were a lot of tourists there as well, some even from the states.

This was my first time being at a music festival, but luckily it wasn't as chaotic as it seems to be in Chicago. The majority of the artists/bands were ones we were both familiar with and the headliners were common names such as Eminem, Robert Plant from Led Zeppelin, Fitz and the Tantrums, Smashing Pumpkins, etc.

Overall it was a great experience!
