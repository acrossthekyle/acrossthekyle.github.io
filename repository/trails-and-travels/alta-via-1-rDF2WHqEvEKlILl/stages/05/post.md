Today's hike was a feast for the eyes, with landscapes that felt almost otherworldly. We started the morning under a full moon, enjoying breakfast in the cozy dining room of Rifugio Averu before setting out. The trail required a bit of backtracking, which allowed us to avoid via ferrata ladders that would have demanded helmets and nerves of steel due to the sheer drop-offs.

Once back on the main trail, the Dolomites revealed their extraordinary beauty. I kept stealing glances behind me, knowing I might otherwise miss something spectacular. Massive boulders seemed to float in the clouds, and one rock formation looked like a throne fit for the gods, perched dramatically on a cliffside.

The trail itself was a constant rhythm of ups and downs. Along the way, we passed larger groups of hikers heading in the opposite direction, which made for a lot of stop-and-go. A few busy roads also interrupted the flow of the trail, but they were a minor inconvenience compared with the incredible scenery surrounding us.

After leaving the larger groups behind, it was just backpackers and the mountains. The geological formations were unlike anything I had ever seen: curved mountains pushed onto their sides, jagged peaks cut off by clouds, and ruins seemingly hovering on the edge of cliffs. Endless stretches of green filled the valleys and hillsides, making every step feel like a journey through another world.

By the end of the day, the trail had left a lasting impression. The combination of unique rock formations, verdant valleys, and cloud-kissed peaks made this section of the Dolomites feel completely magical. It was the kind of hike that reminds you why you come to the mountains: to be inspired, awed, and completely immersed in the natural world.
