Today's hike was all about climbing. We started early, knowing it would be a short day, since our destination was Rifugio Pian de Fontana, the last stop on our trek. After a brief descent, we immediately began ascending toward the cols between mountain peaks. The stone here was a striking white, dotted with dark green vegetation, and the climb demanded frequent breaks to catch our breath. Despite the effort, it was refreshing to be above the forest once again, surrounded by wide-open vistas.

As we gained altitude, we passed patches of ice and were treated to endless views of the surrounding mountains, some wreathed in clouds. At times, it truly felt like standing on the edge of the world. After about an hour and a half of steady climbing, we reached the top and paused to take it all in. The mountains seemed endless in every direction, and the solitude was invigorating.

The trail then led us down between two peaks that appeared split by lightning, opening a natural corridor for our path. A massive wall of rock rose on our left, and distant wildlife, possibly deer or moose, added to the scene. Marmots scurried across grassy fields dotted with dandelions, keeping us company as we made our way through the alpine terrain. Clouds rolled in briefly, only to clear again and reveal the trail ahead.

A challenging set of switchbacks guided us down to our final destination for the night. Rumors of Edelweiss along the switchbacks sparked some excitement, though neither I nor my friend Cerstin spotted any, which was a minor disappointment. Once at Rifugio Pian de Fontana, we were greeted by a herd of sheep that lingered for much of the afternoon before wandering off just before dinner.

The evening was a perfect celebration of the trek's end. We shared a plentiful dinner, plenty of wine, and laughter with our fellow hikers. As night fell, the sky turned brilliant shades of pink and purple, marking the close of an incredible journey. Tomorrow would be all downhill as we aimed to reach the bus stop and reconnect with a friend waiting in town, but tonight was about savoring the final moments on the trail.
