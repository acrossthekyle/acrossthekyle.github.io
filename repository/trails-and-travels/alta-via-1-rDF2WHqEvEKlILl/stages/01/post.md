My friend Cerstin and I caught an early morning shuttle bus from the town where we were staying to Lago Brais, the official starting point of the Alta Via 1. The bus was packed with hikers and their backpacks, so we stood for the ride, eagerly watching the landscape pass by. We were dropped off in front of a hotel at the lake, and it felt like the perfect place to begin our adventure.

Lago Brais is stunning, a turquoise mountain lake nestled at the foot of white-gray peaks. A small dock jutted into the water, lined with old wooden canoes tied up neatly, and a tiny shack sat at the end. We explored the edges of the lake, but it was too vast to circle entirely, and the mountains called us onward.

The trail followed the lake for a while on mostly level ground, giving us a gentle start before the real ascent began. Soon we turned away from the lake and started climbing, stepping carefully over loose rocks. The incline steadily increased, and before long we were stopping frequently to catch our breath. Each glance back offered a shrinking view of the lake, a reminder of how far we had already climbed.

As we gained elevation, the views opened up dramatically. Rolling hills of jagged rock formations stretched into the distance, shaped by tectonic forces into strange and striking angles. Some peaks appeared as if someone had sliced the tops off, while others jutted sharply into the sky. Hiking through this surreal landscape was mesmerizing, and it felt like walking among giant sculptures made by nature itself.

After an hour and a half of traversing the ridges, we caught our first glimpse of Rifugio Bella, the tiny mountain refuge where we would spend the night. Before heading down, we decided to take a side trek up a nearby peak. Ninety minutes later, we reached the summit, and the view was incredible. From up there, Lago Brais was far below, a small jewel in the mountains, and the vertical distance we had climbed felt truly impressive.

We eventually descended to Rifugio Bella, where spacious beds and a hearty dinner awaited us. After eating, we spent the evening talking and drinking with new friends, watching the sun set over the peaks. The sky turned a deep purple as the temperature dropped, and a little fox scampered by, adding to the magic of the mountains. It was the perfect start to our trek, and I couldn't imagine being anywhere else.
