I visited not one, but two of Chile's most iconic wineries: Cousiño Macul and Concha y Toro. Getting out of central Santiago and into the Maipo Valley was surprisingly easy with little traffic, but we also cheated by using another local guide who merely provided the transportation for us. But it did feel a little less touristy.

We started at Cousiño Macul, one of the oldest family-owned vineyards in the country, located right on the edge of the city. The grounds are stunning. It felt like stepping back in time. We joined in with a winery tour and learned a lot about the history of the place, and the history of wine in Chile. We walked through the beautiful vineyards with the Andes in the background, visited the old cellars, and learned how the winemaking process has evolved. The premium tasting was well worth the extra cost.

After a quick lunch, I made my way further out to Pirque for the legendary Concha y Toro. This place is huge and definitely a 'big name' experience, but still fascinating.

The tour here felt more like a show, but in a good way. We walked through the beautiful grounds of the former family mansion and the varietal garden. The highlight, of course, was the famous 'Casillero del Diablo' (Devil's Cellar) legend. The tour guides put on a great little show, and the atmosphere in the spooky, dimly lit cellar was really fun.
