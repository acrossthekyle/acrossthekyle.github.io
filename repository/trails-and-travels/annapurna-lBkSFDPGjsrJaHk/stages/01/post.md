Sleep did not come easy last night. The hostel in Pokhara was full, and the other guests stayed up late and snored loudly. Groggy and hungry, I gathered my things and packed outside to avoid disturbing anyone. The early morning meant no taxis were running, so I walked the ten minutes to the bus station, regretting taking a taxi the day before. A small food stand offered coffee, pastries, and a banana, which I devoured while waiting for the bus to Besishar.

The bus ride to Besishar was long, bumpy, and crowded. Locals boarded with all sorts of items, including furniture, and space grew tight at times. I met the people who would soon become my hiking companions: Katie from New Zealand, Nathan from England, and Véronique from Canada. Nathan realized he had forgotten some essential gear, and we helped him purchase a down jacket and other items for the trek at very reasonable prices.

Finally on the trail, we left the city behind and hiked into the jungle. The path led over a long, narrow suspension bridge spanning a rushing river and opened into bright green fields surrounded by vibrantly colored homes. We became so caught up in conversation that we got lost, relying on a friendly local family to guide us back to the trail. Once back on track, we pressed on, stopping briefly at a small waterfall where my water filter had sprung a leak. Katie's chlorine tablets saved the day.

Crossing more suspension bridges, including one that looked ready to collapse, we finally reached Bhulbule, the village where we would spend the night. Exhausted and hungry, I ate some protein bars and took a much-needed rest on stone steps at the village entrance. Once rested, we began searching for accommodations. The teahouse system relies on local families, and we were lucky to find one with showers, clean rooms, and a dining area. The owner gave us a room for three, adding a fourth mattress to the floor for a discounted rate, provided we ate dinner there.

The day was full of firsts: new friends, a long bus ride, getting lost in the jungle, and nearly collapsing from hunger. Despite the challenges, the warm showers and delicious food made everything worthwhile. It was an eventful start to the Annapurna Circuit, and I was eager to see what tomorrow would bring.
