Today, the mountains finally started to reveal their snow-covered peaks, giving us a glimpse of what was ahead. We crossed another suspension bridge out of town and entered thick forests, a mix of conifer and deciduous trees. A welcoming arch over the trail reminded us we were on a journey meant to be savored.

The trail felt busier today, with hikers arriving from jeeps that bypassed the first sections of the route. It made us feel proud to be doing the full trek from start to finish, taking in every part of the Annapurna Circuit on foot. At the next village, we discovered rows of prayer drums. Spinning them clockwise is said to bring good luck, and we made sure to do it every chance we got.

Another waterfall crossing marked the day, and this time we were fortunate to only lose a single hat. The rest of the hike was spent winding through colorful forests and crossing long suspension bridges. With each step, the peaks in the distance grew larger, snow glinting in the sunlight and promising the challenges to come.

After six hours of hiking, we arrived in Chame, tired but exhilarated. Today reminded us that the circuit is not just about the villages or the paths, but about the small rituals, the bridges, and the ever-changing landscapes that make the journey unforgettable.
