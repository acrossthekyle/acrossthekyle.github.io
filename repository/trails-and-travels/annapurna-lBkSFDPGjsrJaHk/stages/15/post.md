Well rested and well fed, I left Chomrong the next morning to begin the Annapurna Base Camp trek. I would not make it all the way that day, but I covered a good amount of ground and eventually stopped in a place called Deurali. It felt good to be moving forward again with a clear goal ahead.

The day was almost entirely uphill. Leaving Chomrong meant descending all the way to the valley floor before climbing straight back up the other side. The constant elevation gain put real strain on my knees and lungs, and the effort was impossible to ignore.

Most of the trail wound through dense jungle, cool and green despite the effort it demanded. About halfway through the day I stopped for lunch, once again relying on pasta and a couple of cokes to keep my energy up. Not long after, I passed a fascinating stretch of caves with ice and snow forming natural bridges overhead, a reminder of how varied and surprising this trek could be.

By the time I reached the next village, rain had started to fall and it stayed with me for the rest of the afternoon. I arrived in Deurali roughly six hours after setting out and was shown to a room shared with two other trekkers. I hung up my soaked clothes and hoped for the best, grateful at least for the hot showers waiting downstairs.

That evening was quiet and comforting. I spent time reading in the dining hall before joining a group of British hikers who were playing cards over dinner. Tomorrow would be a big day, as the trail would finally lead to Annapurna Base Camp itself.
