We left Chame after a hearty breakfast, the sun already high above us as we followed the fast-flowing river that has accompanied us since the beginning of the trek. Shortly after setting off, we passed a monument declaring "Buddha was born in Nepal," a reminder of the deep cultural history surrounding the trail.

The path was busier than usual, with many porters passing by carrying enormous loads on their backs while walking in sandals. It was humbling to witness the sheer strength and endurance required for this work, and a stark reminder that these mountains demand respect. Another Buddha monument appeared around a bend, and we marveled at the way the trail had been blasted directly out of the vertical rock face. Despite sharing the path with jeeps and motorbikes, the trail was wide enough to navigate safely.

As we gained elevation, the scenery transformed. Trees became sparse, revealing massive mountain faces and the stunning peaks of the Annapurna Massif. Every turn offered new perspectives, and the scale of the mountains made us feel small in the most awe-inspiring way.

Our destination was Upper Pisang, and we arrived in time to settle into a beautiful teahouse with a view that took our breath away. The village is home to a Buddhist temple, and we didn't miss the opportunity to explore it. The temple's colors were unlike anything we had seen, a vivid feast for the eyes that made wandering its grounds a true delight. At this altitude, our puffy jackets were necessary for afternoon walks, a reminder that we were steadily moving into the high Himalayas.
