Visiting the Citadelle de Porto-Vecchio feels like stepping into the layered history of the town while enjoying some of its best views. Set high above the marina, the old stone walls and narrow streets invited me in to wander at an unhurried pace, passing cafes, small shops, and quiet corners that hint at centuries of life within the fortress. From the ramparts, the contrast between the pale stone, the red rooftops below, and the deep blue of the Mediterranean makes it easy to linger and take it all in.
