Today began with a bit of adventure before the hiking even started. A backpacker we'd met at Maya Joie had told us about a massive waterfall just past La Fouly, and I was determined to check it out. Leaving town, we quickly found ourselves in the forest, descending toward a river crossing before continuing north toward the waterfall. What seemed like a gentle path revealed itself as steep and slippery with morning dew, but the payoff was breathtaking. I scrambled carefully near the base of the falls, feeling the spray on my face, and paused to savor the raw power and beauty of the cascading water.

Once back on safer ground, we reunited with other hikers and continued together through the forest. Much of the trail followed a dried-up river, winding through narrow paths with occasional chains to keep us from tumbling over steep drops. Soon, we emerged into the valley villages of Switzerland, with Praz-de-Fort and its neighboring towns greeting us with charming wooden houses, blending new construction with centuries-old barns that looked ready to collapse at the slightest touch. We rested at a cozy café in Issert, indulging in ice cream sandwiches while taking in the surrounding greenery.

The day's climb was deceptively short, about 1.5 hours and under 500 meters of gain, but full of delightful surprises along the way. A cave tempted exploration, and the forest was alive with whimsical wooden carvings of mushrooms, beavers, and antelope. We even spotted locals scaling a small rocky outcrop, a reminder that mountains invite adventure at every turn. The final stretch brought us to the lake at Campex, where we enjoyed pizza and beers before heading to our separate accommodations for the night.

Navigating to my Gîte turned into an unintended adventure of its own. I got lost. Four times. Testing both my patience and problem-solving skills. From following the wrong paths to asking directions from an elderly Swiss lady whose advice involved circular hand gestures, I eventually found my way thanks to a group of helpful teenagers. The misadventures faded as quickly as they came; my Gîte was warm and welcoming, and dinner with a new South Korean friend brought laughter and cultural exchange. I even learned to say "Annyeonghaseyo," though it may take a few more tries to remember it.

By the end of the day, I felt a mix of exhilaration and gratitude, exhilaration from the waterfall and winding trails, and gratitude for the kindness of strangers, the beauty of the Swiss villages, and the resilience built with each step. It was a day that reminded me why I love hiking: the perfect blend of challenge, discovery, and the simple joys of connecting with people along the way.
