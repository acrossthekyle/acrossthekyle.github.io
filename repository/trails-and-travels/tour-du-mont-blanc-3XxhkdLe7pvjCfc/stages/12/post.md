The last morning of the trek was bathed in a stunning orange sunrise, which I tried to capture in every photo as I descended the mountains. Ibexes kept me company along the way, adding a touch of Alpine magic. On my path, I passed the imposing Le Christ Roi statue, a sudden and awe-inspiring sight rising from the valley floor. Crossing the final river and passing the train station, I felt a sense of completion: the journey that had begun days ago now behind me. My hiking boots and backpack were no longer black, but coated with the dust and dirt of countless mountainsides.

With the gîte not opening until later in the afternoon, I wandered around town, exploring souvenir shops and collecting maps. By chance, I ran into four fellow hikers I had met along the route. We shared lunch, drinks, and stories, laughing over mishaps and memories from the trek. A sudden rainstorm forced us inside, reminding me just how unpredictable mountain weather can be.

Once checked in, I was reunited with more friends from day one. One kind hiker even lent me a bus pass to visit Chamonix in search of a pin for my backpack, part of a growing collection from my travels. Chamonix was bustling, filled with shops, restaurants, and tourists. Speed-walking up and down its streets, I finally found the perfect pin and met Barak and Neta one last time, sharing a few laughs before returning for dinner.

Dinner that evening was lively, with tipsy friends spilling wine and telling stories. We lingered in the common room afterward, savoring the camaraderie that had grown over the past days. As night fell, I reflected on the journey, the challenges, the beauty, and the friendships forged along the way.

The next morning, the shuttle sped past the mountains as I headed to the airport. I looked back longingly at the peaks, knowing this trek had changed me. While it wasn't as grueling as the Camino, it had its own trials and triumphs, leaving me stronger and more in awe of Europe than ever before. I cannot wait to return.
