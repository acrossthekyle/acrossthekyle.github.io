What a way to wake up! The sun was bright, the sky scattered with pink-white clouds, and the tall grasses around my tent glowed golden in the morning light. Everyone else was slowly emerging as well, so it was time to make oatmeal, pack up, and prepare for another day on the trail.

This morning, we walked through fields of golden grass that seemed endless. The scenery was breathtaking, but soon enough we began the steady climb up a hill, where the wind picked up and tousled everyone's hair. At the top, we paused to admire the view of a large lake below: a perfect reward for our effort. Descending the hill, the wind eased, and we found ourselves walking through forests of short, round pines and patches of trees recovering from past fires. A turquoise river ran nearby, and we even passed a checkpoint to have our permits checked without any issues.

The trail transitioned through rolling fields of yellow grains and dark green flora, with snow-capped mountains steadily drawing closer. We navigated through marshy lands thanks to a well-maintained boardwalk, a small but essential feature that kept the hike manageable. The mix of landscapes made each step a new discovery, and the ever-present mountains reminded us why we were here.

Eventually, we reached our refugio for the night: Dickson. Nestled on the shores of a large lake and encircled by trees, it offered a large field for tents. Learning from the previous night's winds, we all chose sheltered spots near trees or tall bushes to protect ourselves. Inside, the refugio offered a full kitchen, hot showers, and full bathrooms; luxuries that made the day's hike even sweeter.

The real highlight, however, was the shoreline behind the refugio. I wandered along the rocky beach, snapping photos of the massive mountains that lined the far shore, some of which were actually across the border in Argentina! Standing there, taking in the scenery, I felt the full majesty of Patagonia, and knew that every step to get here was worth it.
