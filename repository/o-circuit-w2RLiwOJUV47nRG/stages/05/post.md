Last night was a rough one. A particularly loud snorer kept me from sleeping, and my earplugs kept falling out. Today promised to be an easier day of hiking, with extra time to explore a side trail that offered incredible views of the mountain near our campsite.

The morning trek took us through a forest of bleached trees, remnants of a fire from years ago. Purple flowers grew among the charred trunks, creating a striking contrast of colors. The trail followed the lake formed by the melting of Grey's Glacier, where small icebergs floated gently in the water. For a while, the glacier remained visible in the distance before the trail turned and it disappeared from view.

All along the route, the trees had been permanently bent by the wind over the years, making for a fascinating sight. The trail itself was mostly rocky, with little shade from the sun. Signs of the old forest fire were everywhere, and the harsh environment was a reminder of nature's power and resilience.

Eventually, we descended into a small valley and reached Paine Grande. A beautiful lake lay nearby, and after setting up our tents, we took a side hike along part of the 'O' Circuit known as The 'Q'. I chose a flat grassy spot for my tent, while others pitched theirs near rocky outcrops or bushes. Fences in the field hinted at how windy the area could get, though I didn't pay much attention at the time.

The side trail provided stunning views of the lake and the sharp, jagged mountain next to our campsite. The waters were cold and shallow, and we spent a couple of hours venturing out into them. By the time we returned to camp, the wind had picked up. Our tents were holding strong, but it was clear that the night ahead would be a blustery one.
