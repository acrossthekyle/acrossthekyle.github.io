After another successful night of sleep, sheltered from the wind by trees and bushes, we woke to a muddy but manageable morning. My thin groundsheet from the previous night had already seen better days and was tossed, but it turned out we wouldn't need it for the rest of the trip.

Most of the morning was spent hiking through hilly forested terrain, with occasional lookout points breaking up the walk. Wooden bridges helped us cross a few rivers, nothing too challenging, and the trail took a surprising right turn away from the distant mountains. The hike became rocky, signaling that the day's real highlight was approaching: a detour to a moraine and glacier just before reaching Los Perros, our campground for the night. Because fewer hikers took this route, we had the glacier mostly to ourselves: a peaceful, icy retreat. We waded into the freezing waters and soaked up the sun on the rocks, savoring the quiet and the view.

Eventually, we continued to Los Perros campground. Nestled mostly in the woods, the sites were muddy but manageable. We chose the driest, safest spots, keeping an eye out for any potential tree hazards. The campground offered modern conveniences: hot showers, bathrooms, and a kitchen, though the dense woods meant there were more bugs than the previous sites. A nearby river provided water, which we filtered for safety.

With camp set up, I took some time to relax in a sunny clearing, reading my book and enjoying the quiet. Other hikers used the downtime differently. Some napped, others chatted, but it was a welcome break after several days of hiking.

Overall, the day was a perfect balance of effort and reward: forest trails, icy water, stunning glacier views, and a peaceful campsite to recharge. Patagonia was already proving itself to be unforgettable.
