    "A tapestry of landscapes surrounding spires of granite, the long-distance trails in Patagonia do not disapoint, with towering granite peaks, sprawling glaciers, pristine lakes, and windswept plains. There are two trekking routes (or circuits) in Torres del Paine National Park: the 'W' and the 'O'. Both routes get their names from each trail's layout, and the O Circuit that I did is a route that runs the entire perimeter of the park, and ends at the same place it starts.",
    "In the winter of 2020, during the second half of February, I traveled to Patagonia to embark on this trail. This was my second time being in the region (my first was in 2016). This trail was a good combination of rustic and modern, and was one of the shorter thru-hikes I have done at %length% days and %distance%. The highlight of the circuit was coming up over the ridge at Grays Pass and seeing the massive Grays Glacier layed out below us. It filled the horizon from end to end.",
    "These pictures showcase my time on trail, and offer a glimpse into the %length% days spent on this thru-hike."
