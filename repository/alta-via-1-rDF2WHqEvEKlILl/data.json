  "description": [
    "I set off for Northern Italy to hike one of seven trails in the Dolomites, collectively called the Alta Via routes. Running North to South, and finishing in Belluno, this classic high route passes through a panorama of jagged ridges, vertical walls, and majestic towers, accumulating in some of the most beautiful mountains in the world.",
    "These pictures showcase some of the amazing natural formations visible from the trail, and offer a glimpse into the %length% days spent on this thru-hike."
