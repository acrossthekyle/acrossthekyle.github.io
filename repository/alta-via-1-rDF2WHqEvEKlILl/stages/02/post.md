Breakfast on the Alta Via 1 was a treat compared to most trekking mornings. Instead of the usual sparse bread and jam, there were eggs and hearty options to fuel the day ahead. Refreshed and well-fed, we left Rifugio Bella and stepped back into the rolling, open terrain of the Dolomites, surrounded by a variety of striking geologic formations. The views felt even more dramatic than the first day, with every turn revealing a new ridge, peak, or rocky outcrop.

The trail took us over grassy hills toward distant mountains, and about seventy minutes in we entered dense pine forests. The smooth rolling terrain gave way to a steep descent, with wooden railings guarding the cliff edges. We carefully made our way down the side of the mountain, following switchbacks into a valley below, where the landscape opened into a peaceful, sunlit refuge.

At the valley floor, a small rifugio appeared, inviting us to rest, eat, and enjoy a second breakfast. After a short break, we pushed on, climbing back up into a new section of the mountains. The trail here was sandy underfoot, possibly an old lakebed or a natural deposit, with switchbacks that made the ascent feel longer, especially after the large meal we had enjoyed.

As we pressed onward, the trail led us past a river running beside a small farmhouse. With no livestock around, we kicked off our shoes and let the icy water wash over our feet, a refreshing and exhilarating pause in the hike. The surrounding mountains, partly cloudy skies, and flowing water made the stop feel like a hidden gem tucked away in the Dolomites.

By evening, we arrived at Rifugio Lavarella, nestled beside a serene lake with cows grazing nearby. The rifugio had an inviting atmosphere with watery features scattered across the property, and the dinner was another highlight of the trek. We relaxed on the patio, watching clouds drift across the sky, chatting with fellow hikers, and even sneaking in some naps. It was a perfect mix of activity and tranquility, showcasing the Alta Via 1 at its best.
