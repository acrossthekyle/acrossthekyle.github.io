The final day on trail was mostly downhill, and we started early to ensure we had plenty of time to catch the bus back into town. From the rifugio, the path initially stretched laterally across the mountains before beginning a steady descent. I paused to take one last look back at the area, and the scenery felt like something out of a dream, with mossy slopes, rolling peaks, and clouds drifting lazily over the valleys.

I kept an eye out for Edelweiss, a flower I had hoped to spot along this part of the trail, but it remained elusive. The terrain transitioned from open, grassy mountainsides to dense forests as we began zig-zagging down steep switchbacks. Along the way, we stopped at a small rifugio with an open kitchen and bathrooms, snacking on leftover pie before continuing downward.

The valley below widened as we descended, giving us breathtaking views both up the mountains we had traversed and down to the river below. It was a chance to reflect on the journey, and the scale of the surrounding landscape made all the effort feel worth it. On the trail, I spoke with other hikers who had experience on the GR20 in Corsica. Their encouragement gave me confidence that if I could complete the Alta Via 1, I could handle other challenging European trails as well.

We reached the end of the hike around 11 a.m. The finish was unceremonious, just a bus stop along a road. Behind it, though, a wide rocky river offered a perfect moment to celebrate. We kicked off our shoes, dipped our feet in the icy water, and laughed as we nearly slipped into the flowing current. It was a simple, joyful way to mark the end of the journey.

Eventually, it was time to regroup, repack, and board the bus back to civilization. The ride was full, giving us time to reflect on an incredible trek. Between the amazing views, fantastic food, well-maintained trails, and great company, this adventure exceeded all expectations. I left thinking about the Alta Via 2, knowing it might be a future journey worth taking.
