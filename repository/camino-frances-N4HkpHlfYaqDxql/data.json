  "description": [
    "Starting on the border between France and Spain, high in the Pyrenees mountains, and leading to the Atlantic ocean, the Camino Frances is part of a series of ancient routes that unfold across Europe called the Camino de Santiago: a network of pilgrimages leading to the city of Santiago de Compostela in northwestern Spain. I spent weeks walking hundreds of miles over hills and mountains, through deserts, across rivers, and under thick forests.",
    "It's hard to capture %length% days worth of experiences in these snapshots, but hopefully they offer a picture of my journey on this adventure, and a glimpse into the time spent on this thru-hike."
