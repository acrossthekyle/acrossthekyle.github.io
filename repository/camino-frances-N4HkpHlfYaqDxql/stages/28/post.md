Today was the last official day of walking the Camino Frances in full, and anticipation hung in the air. After nearly 45 kilometers of walking in a single day, we all took a late start. Our first stop was Boente for breakfast, where we hoped for a priestly blessing but settled for the required stamp instead. These stamps are essential for earning the certificate at the end of the journey, and getting two per day has become routine.

The trail passed through several small towns, each blending together as the sun climbed higher. The heat was intense, and the beginnings of sunburn were inevitable. We arrived in Arzúa after a couple of hours, and then continued on to Arca, also known as O Pedrouzo, around 5 p.m. It was a slow day compared to other stages, but over 30 kilometers still left us physically spent. A light rain threatened as we tried to reconnect with Eileen and Mauro via free WiFi at a local bar.

Finding accommodations proved to be a challenge. After trying four different places, we finally secured beds at a hotel/albergue called Porta de Santiago. Eileen and Mauro joined us there, and it felt good to be reunited after a long day on the trail. The place was comfortable and reasonably priced, which was a relief after the day's long trek.

With a concert happening in Santiago this weekend, we quickly realized that hostels and albergues were filling up fast. Following Eileen's advice, we started looking into reservations but ended up deciding to wing it, trusting that things would work out.

As we settled in for the night, I couldn't help but feel the weight of the month-long journey coming to a close. Tomorrow we would reach Santiago, the city that had been on our minds for nearly thirty days, and the sense of accomplishment was already beginning to sink in.
