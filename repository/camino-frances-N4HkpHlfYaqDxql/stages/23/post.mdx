Another hot day of walking alone, but it ended with a reunion of nearly everyone
in our new group, and a swim in the Rio Burbia. I attempted to get an early start
with everyone else, but that wasn't going to happen. We made it as far as the
castle before I realized I had forgotten my food for the day in the fridge of
the Albergue, so I had to turn around and go back.

Luckily, we had only made it as far as the castle before I remembered, but
this also meant that I would be walking alone today.

The walk out of the city didn't take too long, and it was mostly along the river.
After a steep uphill climb, and a walk through an old park and past
a church, I was out in the countryside. But this was short live as the next
town over came into view. I powered through it simply because it was too early
for breakfast, and I knew I had to try and make up for lost time to catch up
with my friends.

As I left the first town behind I snacked on a banana that I had bought the
previous day. As I walked along the Calle del Peregrino through the farmlands
between the first town and the next I listened to some music while I ate. Shortly
thereafter I came upon the next town of Fuentesnuevas. There was nothing of
note for me to stop and see here.

Once more unto the rural space of land between towns. Camponaraya, my next
port of call on todays journey, had a small juice and cafe stand along the route
and I stopped for some orange juice, just so I could use the bathroom. I didn't
need to buy any food from here as I still had breakfast items from the grocery
store yesterday. I sat for about 30 minutes as I enjoyed my orange juice, ate
another banana (living the pilgrim life on the cheap isn't very exciting when
it comes to food), and researched places to stay in the last town of the day.

With still no sign of any familiar faces, I set off once more. About an hour
later I came upon a town called Cacabellos. It had some very interesting
Egyptian-looking wall art on some of the buildings as I passed. Upon arriving
I tried to find another "Green Garden" spot for some lunch. No such luck. This
meant going until the next town of Piero before finding another bathroom, and
rest.

In Piero I found a Donativo place to eat my lunch just outside of the city. It
was a cute little place that had places to read both inside and out. I got
a KAS "energy" drink. I chose a spot near the window so that I could watch the
road and wait for Crissi and Maddy while I ate my sandwhich that I had rushed
back to the Albergue this morning for, but I never saw them. At least the
sandwich was good!

Villafranca del Bierzo was the next town, and the stage ender for today. I made
it there in about 90 minutes after leaving Piero. I initially started to take
the route that went along the road but then I came across a more scenic route
which diverted a little bit, but was a lot nicer than worrying about cars.

After a short descent into the outskirts of the city, I checked out the
Municipal Albergue, but it was closed when it should have been open. Instead of
waiting around for it to open, and risk losing a bed elsewhere, I decided
to skip it and go to the next place that I had researched which was Albergue
Leo. I fell in love with it as soon as I walked in the front door.

I quickly texted those whose phone numbers I had, and they all met up at my
place. I was happy to see everyones lovely face again. After getting stuff for
lunch we went to meet up with Louis at a bar, and hopped to a few different
places before finding a spot for food.

On the way back to the Albergue we ran into the girls from Texas who we had met
several days earlier in Belorado, and who we have seen here and there on the
way. They were going back to the river, so we followed them and hung out while
doing some swimming, skipping stones, and talking. It was a really good way to
spend the afternoon in the heat. I think it got up to 100F today.

We tried to beat the heat and came back to the Albergue to play some cards in
order to pass the time. We hit the hay early since we were preparing for our
earliest day yet: leaving before 5am.
