Another hot day on the Camino started with a mishap: I realized I had left my food back at the albergue and had to double back, meaning I would be walking alone for most of the day. Once I finally left the city, the route followed the river and soon led into the countryside. The first town I passed was too early for breakfast, so I pushed through, snacking on a banana I had brought along while listening to music as the farmlands rolled by.

Fuentesnuevas passed without incident, and Camponaraya offered a small cafe and juice stand where I stopped for orange juice and a short break. I spent some time planning accommodations for the day's final town, catching my breath before pressing on. Cacabellos featured interesting Egyptian-style wall art, but I found no place to rest or eat. Lunch only came in Piero, where a quiet Donativo spot allowed me to eat my sandwich while watching the road, hoping to catch up with friends, but they never appeared.

Villafranca del Bierzo marked the stage end for the day. I took a scenic detour off the road, which made the journey far more pleasant than worrying about traffic. The municipal albergue was closed, so I headed to Albergue Leo, instantly falling in love with the cozy space. Soon after, I reconnected with my friends, and together we explored the town, grabbed food, and later reunited with the girls from Texas for an afternoon of swimming in the Rio Burbia, skipping stones, and enjoying the summer heat.

The day ended quietly back at the albergue with some card games to pass the time. The heat had been relentless, reaching nearly 100°F, so we took refuge indoors and prepared for the next day: our earliest departure yet, leaving before 5 a.m. Despite the solo start, the day ended with laughter, friendship, and a perfect afternoon by the river, a reminder of the small joys the Camino offers.
