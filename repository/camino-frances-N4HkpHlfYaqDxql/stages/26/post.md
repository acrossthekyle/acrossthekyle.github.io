This is the second time I've had to say goodbye to people I had grown close to. It feels surreal to think that we are almost at the end: only three more days until Santiago. Today we parted ways with our group. Louis pushed on, completing two stages in a single day, while Maddy, Cerstin, and Isabelle took it easy and stayed at the previous stage. Mauro and Eileen continued on to Gonzar, and Crissi and I chose to remain in Pontemarion.

I knew these moments were part of the Camino, but experiencing them first-hand was something else entirely. To become so connected to people you share laughter, pain, and memories with is a unique experience. The bonds formed along the trail are something I have never truly felt before. As strange as it sounds, I can already see myself doing this all over again.

Today's walk was relatively easy. I took it slow because of my right ankle tendon issues, but the compression sock kept things manageable. Crossing another small mountain on the way out of Sarria, the forests and tiny villages passed by almost in a blur. We stopped for breakfast at a small cafe outside Morgade, and shortly after, we reached the 100-kilometer marker.

Pontemarion appeared ahead, and we chose the safer approach into town. The alternative route went down old dirt and brick steps and was recommended only for those in excellent shape. Once in town, Crissi and I decided to stay while Eileen and Mauro continued onward. Settling into a bar, we quickly realized how much we already missed their company.

During dinner, we entertained the idea of taking a two-day trip to Porto, Portugal, just to make use of the extra time we had. We had been pushing through stages with energy and focus, and figured everyone else would be too far ahead or behind to meet again.

Regardless of our plans, we are excited to celebrate the Fourth of July from Fisterra, Spain, knowing that the last days of this journey are fast approaching. The memories of these friendships and the trail itself will stay with me long after we reach Santiago.
