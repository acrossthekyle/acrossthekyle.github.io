Walking through Roman ruins after being reunited with a traveling companion is an experience you don't pass up. Our hosts decided to turn on the lights at 6 a.m., giving everyone a rude awakening and causing minor chaos in the dormitory. We packed up quickly and retraced our steps over the bridge to get back on the Camino. This town wasn't even on the original route anymore, having been relocated to higher ground after a historic flood.

The morning hike took us uphill past corn storage houses and through the charred remains of a forest. Ninety minutes later, we arrived in Castromaior after passing through Gonzar. The albergue there had a restaurant, which was a lifesaver since we were starving. Walking in, we were greeted by Eileen, a fellow pilgrim we had said goodbye to only the day before. It felt like pure fate to be reunited so quickly, and we enjoyed breakfast together before continuing our trek.

Shortly after leaving Castromaior, we came across the ruins of a Roman encampment. Walking among the ancient structures and seeing remnants of kitchens and bathrooms was incredible. Being able to reach out and touch history in a way you rarely can back home was humbling. We paused again to wait for Eileen outside Hospital Alta da Cruz before heading to Palas de Rei, where a solid lunch fueled our decision to "turn on Beast Mode" and push for Melide, about 14 kilometers away.

The walk to Melide was challenging, but full of laughter and conversation. Just as we reached the outskirts of town, we spotted Mauro leaving a handwritten note on the bridge, telling us to meet him in town. Seeing his note felt like a perfect, whimsical moment after such a long day of walking.

Once in Melide, we found a great place to stay with a green backyard, and later ran into Sam, who is finishing the Camino with a hefty 40-pound backpack. Dinner was a highlight: Pulpo a la Gallega, a local specialty of boiled octopus with olive oil, paprika, bread, and white wine. Every bite felt like a reward.

The day was full of unexpected joy. Being reunited with familiar faces, discovering historical sites, and savoring local food reminded me of why the Camino continues to be such a meaningful journey.
