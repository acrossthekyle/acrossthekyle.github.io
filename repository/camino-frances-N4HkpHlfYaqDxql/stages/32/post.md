We decided to combine multiple stages and finish the Camino together. The morning began with an epic sunrise as we left Olveiroa, walking through the mist toward Hospital. Breakfast at a small café gave us time to rest, but shortly after, the choice became clear: Fisterra or Muxía. Mauro joined us, and soon we were hiking through forests and hills, catching our first glimpses of the ocean and the towns of Cee and Corcubión. Along the way, we picked up Anna from Hungary, a new walking companion who would share in our final stretch.

The walk along the bay was stunning, even if we got briefly lost and had to make our own path to reconnect with the Camino. Lunch was simple: sandwiches from yesterday enjoyed at the water's edge, but the moment was unforgettable. Saying goodbye to friends along the way was bittersweet, yet Crissi and I felt a sudden spark of determination: we would keep going and reunite with them. Within an hour, we found ourselves at the beach near Estorde, spotting Anna in the distance. The small detour to rest and have coffee turned into a magical moment of reunion.

Finally, Fisterra appeared on the horizon. Walking into town, the sun emerged, illuminating the path to the 0 km marker, the official end of the Camino. Arriving there was overwhelming. We walked up to the lighthouse, claimed our spots on the rocks, and sat in silence for nearly an hour, staring out at the vast ocean. I reflected on everything that had brought me here, letting awe and gratitude wash over me. It was the true end of the journey, a final punctuation mark to a month-long adventure.

Reunions continued as Mauro joined us on the rocks, and we headed back into town to find accommodation. After several full Albergues, we ended up at a Hungarian-owned hostel, sharing a room with Anna and later spotting Cerstin. Dinner with friends, a walk along the "hippy" beach, and even glimpses of dolphins made the evening feel surreal. Words cannot fully capture the magic of this day or the friendships formed along the Camino.

The next morning, July 5th, brought final goodbyes to everyone as they caught buses back to Santiago and onward home. Crissi and I spent the day walking along the beach, collecting shells, exploring Fisterra, visiting the pilgrim museum, and returning to our favorite restaurant. At night, we sat in the plaza, watching the sun set over the place we had dreamed of reaching.

July 7th, 2018, marked my final departure. Crissi left early to catch her train, and we exchanged one last hug and words of thanks. Alone, I boarded the bus for the airport, reflecting on the Camino's lessons, the people I met, and the journey that will stay with me forever. I left Spain with a full heart and the promise to return someday.
