Our day began with a descent from Rifugio Tissi, retracing part of yesterday's path before heading off in a new direction. We walked briefly along a ridge I've dubbed "The Wall," then entered a small cluster of pine trees before emerging into a cleared valley. Up ahead, a herd of cows ambled lazily through the landscape. Unlike my last encounter with cattle, these cows were completely indifferent to our presence, and we shared the trail with them for a short while before a wire fence marked their boundary.

The trail led us into another pine forest tucked between dramatic mountain spires that resembled chimney stacks. A waterfall turned into a river in the distance, though we crossed over the top rather than below it, missing a few photo opportunities. It took about an hour to navigate the forested section, after which the trail began a steady ascent toward the rocky mountain faces. Snow lingered in the shadows, clinging stubbornly to hidden nooks.

As the trail curved around the mountainside, we passed through a narrow gap that felt straight out of a fantasy film. Here, we met a fellow hiker from Germany tackling a much longer trek through the Alps and Dolomites, whose path overlapped with the Alta Via 1. This brief encounter added a sense of camaraderie to our journey and highlighted the shared experiences of those drawn to these mountains.

After the bend, it was time to begin the descent. The path wound through a deciduous forest scattered with stumps, rocks, and wooden benches for resting. I paused for a break, and a butterfly settled on my backpack, offering a peaceful moment before the rest of the group caught up. The forested descent felt calming and rejuvenating after the climbs and narrow passes of the morning.

Finally, we arrived at Rifugio Carestiato, perched atop a rocky outcrop overlooking a lush valley. Clouds drifted past the distant mountains, and the presence of the forest around the rifugio made for a serene atmosphere. The evening was spent relaxing, playing cards, and enjoying dinner together, a quiet and well-earned conclusion to a day filled with dramatic landscapes and shared moments in the mountains.
