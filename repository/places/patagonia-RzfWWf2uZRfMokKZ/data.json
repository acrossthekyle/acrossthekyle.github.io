    "In Patagonia, the landscape feels vast and wild, with jagged mountains, turquoise lakes, and open plains stretching as far as the eye can see. Trails wind through national parks like Torres del Paine, offering easy access to dramatic scenery while still feeling remote. Patagonia mixes raw natural beauty with a sense of adventure, where you can move from lakeshores to glaciers and back."
