Today started on a bit of a low note. Breakfast was yogurt with granola, toast, and coffee, and it didn't hit the spot. We took the Bovine trail, and while the climb through the woods was gradual, our legs soon felt the climb.

It was one of those 'cat and mouse' days on the trail, constantly passing and being passed by Mackenzie, Kaitlyn, Angel, and the three British ladies. At one point, the fatigue really hit, but then, the trail provided.

Just before reaching the summit, we hit a refuge famous for its cakes. We staged a long, glorious intervention for our spirits, chatting with the British women over apple crumble, apple quiche, and chocolate. That sugar boost was exactly what we needed for the final push and the subsequent descent. Along the way, we spotted a helicopter hovering nearby; we couldn't tell if it was a rescue mission or just a supply drop, but it's always a sobering reminder of how remote these mountains are.

We rolled into Trient around 1:30 PM, but with check-in not until 3:00 PM, we made ourselves at home in the grass at the camping area. We knocked out the daily chores of bathroom, laundry, and a blissfully hot shower, and spent the afternoon listening to podcasts while our clothes dried in the sun.

Our accommodation tonight is a 12-person dorm, and we were the first ones to claim our spots. After a little more socializing with Angel and Milene at the restaurant, we retreated to our beds for a pre-dinner recharge.

Dinner was a bit of a quiet affair. We were at a table for eight, but only six of us showed up. Our companions included two Germans who didn't say much beyond 'hello', an older Frenchman with zero English, and a younger French runner who was tackling the trail in the opposite direction. He was friendly and chatted as best he could!

The meal was solid: a very good, thick squash soup, a cheese omelette with veggies and fries, and lemon vanilla ice cream for dessert.

Now, it's back to the dorm to rest up. Tomorrow, we keep moving!
