We learned a hard lesson today: skipping breakfast is a massive mistake. Even though the initial ascent wasn't incredibly steep or long, we felt it. We managed to choke down some protein bars on the way up, and by the time we reached the top to eat with Angel, we finally started to feel human again.

Lunch was a classic trail smorgasbord: hard-boiled eggs, crackers with Babybel cheese, and a much-needed chocolate bar.

From there, we headed up toward the Aiguilles. This was easily one of the most beautiful sections yet: wildflowers were everywhere, and the trail involved some really fun rock scrambles. At one point, we found a perfect little rock nook to sit in; Mackenzie and Kaitlyn were there to capture the moment!

The descent was long but manageable, featuring more scrambling before dropping into forest switchbacks. We eventually arrived at Refuge de la Boerne, which is officially the weirdest place we've stayed yet. It feels exactly like the inside of an 18th-century sailing ship. Our room features a 'four-stack' of bunk beds. We're sharing the space with three older American men and Moris and Olga from the Netherlands.

Before dinner, we enjoyed a delightful 'happy hour' with Moris, Olga, and James and Adriana (Americans living in England). It is so wonderful to have made actual friends on this journey! We may have enjoyed one too many Aperol Spritzes (the classic Italian drink), but it was the perfect way to toast to the day.

Dinner was a lovely, social affair. We sat with the three British ladies along with three Belgian campers. The conversation was fantastic. We feasted on: lettuce and corn salad with balsamic, unlimited fresh baguettes, rice and lentils, brie and applesauce for dessert (a surprisingly great combo!).

The night wound down with a funny group chat about the wonders of Neosporin with the Brits and Jess's family. It's surprisingly quiet in our rooms, and we're ready for some rest before the final legs of this adventure!
