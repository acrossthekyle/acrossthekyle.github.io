Today promised an incredible mix of terrain: sandy and stony beaches I hadn't expected to encounter in Patagonia, and rolling grassy fields. Our goal was Refuge Chileno, part of the 'W' section of the 'O' Circuit, and the base for anyone aiming to hike to the Towers.

As we walked along the beaches, I spotted some water spouts in the distance. Another reminder that this trek has been nothing but spectacular views. After about ninety minutes, we left the water behind and returned to more familiar terrain. It was the same area we had passed through about a week ago when we first set out from the welcome center.

The trail today was busier than usual, with day hikers crossing our path, which threw us off at first. Despite the increased traffic, I felt a strong sense of nostalgia. This was the same route I had day-hiked four years ago, nearly to the day. It brought back vivid memories, and everything felt oddly familiar.

For this stop, I had booked a bunk bed, a welcome treat after six nights of camping. I didn't purchase the refuge dinner, opting to make my own backpacking meal instead. Others had also skipped the meal, though I couldn't help but notice it looked delicious. We went to bed early tonight, knowing we'd wake at 3 a.m. to hike in the dark to the Towers and catch the sunrise.
