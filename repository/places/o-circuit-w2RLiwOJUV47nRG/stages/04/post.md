My tent's bottom was covered in mud, but luckily only half of it had been affected, so it wasn't too much to worry about. Today's goal was ambitious: reaching Grey's Glacier and crossing the highest point of the trail. As soon as we left Los Perros behind, the climbing began in earnest.

The ascent was grueling, especially after a few days of easier, near-level walking. I found myself stopping often to catch my breath, but the effort was worth it. The lush green forest gradually gave way to rocky, barren mountainsides dotted with snow patches. The higher we climbed, the more breathtaking the view became.

After roughly 90 minutes, we reached the top of the pass. Spread out before us was the massive, white expanse of Grey's Glacier. I had never seen a glacier up close and from such a vantage point, and we spent over an hour just marveling at its scale and majesty. The sheer immensity of it was humbling, a reminder of nature's grandeur.

The descent proved even trickier. We zig-zagged down narrow rock paths, crossed a long suspension bridge, and navigated dozens of forested switchbacks. The dense trees created a stifling atmosphere, pushing me to pick up my pace as I hurried down. Once on flat ground, I power-walked toward Refugio Grey, passing signs of wildlife along the trail: scat from pumas and other wild cats that kept me alert and motivated.

Refugio Grey was a welcome sight. Its large field made for perfect tent setup, and the refuge itself was ideal for relaxing. I spent the evening in one of the adirondack-style chairs outside, enjoying dinner while watching the sun set over the mountains. A peaceful and satisfying end to a challenging day.
