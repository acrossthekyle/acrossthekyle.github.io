- **Trailhead:** Grays Peak Trailhead
- **Peak:** 14,253 ft

For my final 14'er of this Colorado trip, I chose Grays Peak, a popular summit that begins above the treeline. This meant skipping the two-hour forest slog I had endured on previous hikes, which was a welcome change. I also hoped this peak would provide an opportunity to meet fellow hikers and campers along the way.

The night before, I met two women camping nearby in hammocks. We shared dinner and conversation, and although our paths would briefly cross again near the summit, this was the only time we connected. After three consecutive days of hiking, I was exhausted, so I opted to climb only Grays instead of combining it with Torreys as part of the common saddle route.

I started the trail around 4:30 am. The initial section followed a gently ascending valley along a river, which I could fully appreciate only on the way back down. The high starting altitude meant I was already quite elevated after a short hike. Pausing at just the right moment, I watched a red sun rise over the distant ridges, a sight that remains one of my favorite memories. The trail gradually became busier as more hikers began their climbs.

About two and a half hours in, the trail steepened toward the summit, forcing frequent breaks as my heart adjusted to the high altitude. The pink light of the sunrise bathed the landscape in a magical glow, making every pause worthwhile. By 8:30 am, I reached the summit and was rewarded with breathtaking 360-degree views. High winds prompted me to huddle behind a rock wall with some new friends, giving us a chance to admire the trail I had just conquered from above.

The descent was a joy as the sunlight brought out the greens of the alpine vegetation. By noon, I returned to my car and headed to a nearby campground, reflecting on an unforgettable long weekend of hikes. Grays Peak offered the perfect combination of challenging altitude, scenic views, and the unique pleasure of hiking entirely above the trees.
