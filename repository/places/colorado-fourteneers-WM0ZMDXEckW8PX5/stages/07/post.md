- **Trailhead:** Kite Lake
- **Peak:** 14,282 ft

After our challenging experience on Mt. Shavano, we made sure to carry as much water as possible for our attempt at the DeCaLiBro-n combination route two days later. This route connects four 14,000-foot peaks: Democrat, Cameron, Lincoln, and Bross via ridges, making it theoretically doable in a single day. We skipped Bross since it's on private land, sticking with the first three summits instead.

The trailhead at Kite Lake starts at 12,000 feet, which made the 2,000 feet of elevation gain to the first peak feel easier. We spent the night in the car to acclimate, knowing that starting at high altitude without preparation can be tough. A pink sunrise greeted us as we set out at 7:00 am. The trail began gently, then climbed via switchbacks toward the col at the base of the first peak.

Old mining remnants dotted the landscape, including rusted metal and collapsed mine entrances, adding a touch of history to the hike. The absence of trees allowed panoramic views at every turn. Kite Lake below looked exactly like a kite, a reminder of just how far we could see and how far we still had to go.

We reached Democrat first, summiting in under an hour from the col. After a brief rest and photos, we crossed loose rock to reach Cameron about 1.5 hours later. Its dome shape made the next stretch toward Lincoln a gentle slope. Lincoln required minor scrambling near the top, with a long flat section in the middle between peaks. By 12:30 pm, we had completed all three summits, able to see nearly the entire trail from Lincoln. Looking back, Cameron appeared as a floating rocky island in the sky, a surreal perspective.

The descent followed the same route, back over Cameron and Democrat to Kite Lake. We practically raced down, exhilarated and exhausted from completing such an epic route. Compared to Mt. Shavano, this hike felt smoother and more rewarding. Finishing the DeCaLiBro-n combination left us with a huge sense of accomplishment and memories of a truly spectacular alpine day.
