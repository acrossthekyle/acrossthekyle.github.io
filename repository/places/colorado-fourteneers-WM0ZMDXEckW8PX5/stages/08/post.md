Returning to Colorado for my fourth year in a row, I decided to start the trip with Mt. Belford, a peak with 4,500 feet of elevation gain over just four miles. The steepness promised a tough day, and it quickly became clear this would be one of the most physically demanding peaks I'd tackled solo, even compared to my first summit on Mt. Elbert.

I arrived at the parking lot around 6:00 am and was greeted by empty spaces, with only a few other hikers beginning their day. The trail started immediately steep, climbing roughly 1,000 feet per mile. I stopped often in the early stretch to catch my breath, winding through thick forests punctuated by stream crossings with bridges made from fallen logs. Grassy clearings appeared here and there, providing a chance to pause and look ahead at the trail. The ruins of an old cabin added a little intrigue to the route.

After two and a half hours, I emerged above the treeline, walking through a valley shaded by the surrounding mountains. The trail eased for a while, allowing me to regain my stamina and enjoy the views of the peaks around me. Eventually, it was time to start ascending the valley's sides, and four hours in, I finally gained a vantage point over other mountains in the distance. The deep blue sky and scattered white clouds made the long effort feel worth it.

Five hours into the hike, I reached the ridge with the summit in sight. Forty-five minutes later, I arrived at the top. A few other hikers passed by, continuing along a combination route, but I focused on just the single peak. The wind and chill at the summit were sharp, yet the exhilaration of reaching the USGS elevation marker made all the effort worthwhile.

The descent was just as challenging. I slipped on loose scree early on, earning a few cuts and scrapes, but nothing serious. Dark clouds loomed in the distance, so I kept moving steadily, avoiding photos and distractions. After three and a half hours, I returned to the car exhausted but relieved. Mt. Belford was a brutal day-one peak, but it set the tone for the rest of the trip and reminded me why Colorado's 14'ers are so unforgettable.
