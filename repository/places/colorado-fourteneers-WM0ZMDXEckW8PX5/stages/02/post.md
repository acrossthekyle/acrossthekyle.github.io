- **Trailhead:** McCullough Gulch
- **Peak:** 14,230 ft

The morning after completing my first 14'er, I found myself waking up before dawn once again to tackle another peak. This one was known to be less strenuous than Mt. Elbert, but having conquered the tallest and most challenging of the "easier" 14'ers gave me confidence. I was still curious to see how my body would handle this fresh ascent.

After a two-and-a-half-hour drive listening to my trusty 80's retro station, I parked along the roadside near the trailhead. There was no official parking lot, just a small space where a few other early hikers had already gathered. The trail began immediately at the edge of the road, and by 4:30 am I was setting out under the dim light of my headlamp.

The trail wound through the woods in a series of switchbacks, many with stairs carved out of the rock. It made the climb more manageable, though my legs were still sore from the previous day's hike. Hikers were spaced evenly along the trail, allowing me to hike mostly solo while still feeling reassured by the distant glimmers of their headlamps.

By 6:00 am, I emerged above the treeline just in time for a stunning sunrise. The trail from the trees to the summit was marked with large cairns, which added a fun element for photographs. Most of the path consisted of rock-cut stairs, spaced like regular steps, which made the pace predictable. Along the way, I spotted small chirping Pikas scurrying among the rocks, a delightful reminder of the wildlife thriving at these elevations.

The ridge leading to the summit shifted from stairs to a scree-filled path, with occasional snow patches along the sides. Despite this, I reached the summit by 8:00 am, nearly two hours faster than my Mt. Elbert climb. At the top, I enjoyed the views, snapped photos, and even chatted with fellow hikers, who offered a free beer and good company. Descending with another hiker helped me maintain a steady pace over the well-maintained trail. My knees held up thanks to my braces, and by 1:00 pm I was back at the car, tired but elated.

This hike was a perfect contrast to my first 14'er: easier, social, and immensely rewarding. The combination of a manageable trail, friendly fellow hikers, and even a free beer made it one of the most positive experiences of the trip. I left knowing I would be returning next year to explore even more of Colorado's majestic peaks.
