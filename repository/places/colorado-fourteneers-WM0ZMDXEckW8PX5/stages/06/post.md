- **Trailhead:** Shavano Trailhead
- **Peak:** 14,115 ft

This year, my partner joined me for my new September tradition of hiking Colorado 14'ers, turning it into a bigger adventure since she had family in the state. After spending a week visiting them, we headed into the mountains to tackle our first peak together: Mt. Shavano. It was a Class 2 trail with significant elevation gain of around 4,500 feet, making it challenging but manageable.

We camped at the trailhead in my small Duplex Zpacks tent. Technically designed for two, it felt cramped with our air mattresses, which meant a restless night and little sleep. Despite that, we were eager to get going and hit the trail by 5:00 am. The early stretch was flat, sharing some trail with the Colorado Trail, before ascending over rocks and tree roots. Small water sources dotted the way, though we didn't stop to refill, which would later prove a mistake.

After two and a half hours, we emerged above the trees and paused to take in the stunning views. Since this was my partner's first time above 9,000 feet, we proceeded slowly, watching for any signs of altitude sickness and taking frequent breaks. The ascent beyond the treeline took longer than usual, partly due to COVID-related fitness setbacks and the need to acclimatize. We saw maybe three other hikers all day, which made the experience feel very solitary.

As we approached the col between peaks, we began the final push toward the summit. About halfway up, we stopped to snack and catch our breath. A hiker descending warned us that the summit views weren't worth the tricky conditions, and with our water nearly gone, we decided to turn back. The descent was exhausting. The sun beat down, and our dehydration made each step feel heavier than the last. Nearly three hours later, we stumbled across the smallest trickle of water between rocks. The relief of rehydrating after hours without water was indescribable.

Once back at the car, we reflected on the day. Mt. Shavano had been the toughest and longest 14'er we'd done to date. The lack of water on the trail and the tricky summit conditions turned it into a serious challenge, but it was also a memorable adventure. We left grateful for our safety, our perseverance, and the experience of tackling the mountain together.
