- **Trailhead:** Halfmoon Trailhead
- **Peak:** 14,421 ft

I first learned about 14'ers, the mountain peaks that rise above 14,000 feet, from someone I met while hiking the Tour du Mont Blanc in 2018. They mentioned that if I enjoyed hiking the high trails of the TMB, I would love Colorado, a place I had never considered visiting. It took nearly a year before I finally worked up the courage to take a solo trip to the United States and attempt to summit one of these towering peaks.

After researching what to pack for the trail, where to stay, and how to manage transportation, I booked flights and reserved an Airbnb in Denver. Excitement mixed with nerves filled me as I prepared for the unknown. This trip was also a test of my body's endurance at high altitudes. I wanted to see how I would handle elevations above 10,000 feet, where Acute Mountain Sickness can make every step feel heavier than the last. Success on this hike was critical, as I had a planned trek in the Annapurna region just months away, where elevations rise above 18,000 feet.

I chose Mt. Elbert as my first summit. Being the tallest peak in Colorado, I figured I might as well start big. The night before the hike, my anticipation kept me awake, and I barely got any sleep. I left Denver at 2:00 am, driving the empty highways to the trailhead while listening to an 80's retro station. The road was rough with potholes, but the rental car managed it without trouble.

Arriving at the trailhead around 4:30 am, I was relieved to see other hikers preparing as well. The parking lot quickly filled, a testament to the trail's popularity. Once suited up, I started the ascent, immediately feeling the strain of the altitude. The forested trail lasted about two hours, and I had to stop frequently to catch my breath, though thankfully there were no signs of altitude sickness. I remained alert for bears, especially when I was alone in the dark, finding comfort whenever a distant headlamp appeared.

Breaking above the treeline in time for sunrise was a magical reward. I paused to savor the moment and eat a protein bar before continuing. The climb ahead included multiple false summits, and each glimpse of the peak forced me to stop repeatedly to regulate my breathing. Finally, around 10:00 am, I reached the true summit. The 360-degree views were breathtaking, and the sense of accomplishment was overwhelming. I lingered for thirty minutes to eat lunch and soak in the scenery before starting my descent to avoid the predicted afternoon thunderstorms.

The trail back through the trees felt longer and more exhausting than the ascent, with the rising heat making the forest feel stifling. After about four hours, I finally returned to the car. The drive back to Denver gave me a chance to reflect on the day, and a simple pasta dinner followed by collapsing into bed was the perfect ending to an unforgettable adventure.
