- **Trailhead:** Halfmoon Trailhead
- **Peak:** 14,421 ft

Being the tallest peak in Colorado, I figured I might as well start big. The night before the hike, my anticipation kept me awake, and I barely got any sleep. I left Denver at 2:00 am and drove for roughly 2.5 hours. The road leading up to the trailhead was littered with potholes as I arrived at the trailhead around 4:30 am and started the ascent.

Immediately I felt the strain of the altitude. The forested portion of the trail lasted for about two hours, and I had to stop frequently to catch my breath, though thankfully there were no signs of altitude sickness.

Breaking above the treeline in time for sunrise was a magical reward. The climb ahead included multiple false summits, and each glimpse of the peak forced me to stop repeatedly to regulate my breathing. Finally, around 10:00 am, I reached the true summit. The 360-degree views were breathtaking, and the sense of accomplishment was overwhelming. I lingered for thirty minutes to eat lunch and soak in the scenery before starting my descent to avoid the predicted afternoon thunderstorms.

The trail back through the trees felt longer and more exhausting than the ascent, with the rising heat making the forest feel stifling. After about four hours, I finally returned to the car. The drive back to Denver gave me a chance to reflect on the day, and a simple pasta dinner followed by collapsing into bed was the perfect ending to an unforgettable adventure.
