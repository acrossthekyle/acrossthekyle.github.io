- **Trailhead:** Halfmoon Trailhead
- **Peak:** 14,366 ft

Mount Massive, the second-highest summit in Colorado, is just a few feet shy of Mount Elbert and ranks as the third-highest peak in the contiguous United States. Located in the San Isabel National Forest near Leadville, it offers a mix of grassy slopes, rocky ridges, and sweeping views of the surrounding Rockies. I had been anticipating this hike for a while, knowing the trail would challenge both endurance and focus.

The beginning of the trail is deceptively easy, tempting hikers to move quickly, but summiting a 14'er is more like running a marathon than a sprint. I had a small navigational hiccup early on, with a misleading marker forcing me to bushwhack briefly before rejoining the correct path. Once back on track, I moved steadily, reaching the treeline after roughly two hours.

Crossing over grassy slopes, the trail gradually climbed into switchbacks that gained elevation quickly. Eventually, the path transitioned into a rocky approach, requiring careful footing as the rocks grew larger and more frequent. By the four-hour mark, I reached the steeper section leading to the summit. Some parts were tricky, with steep drop-offs and the need for frequent breaks to catch my breath.

From this vantage point, Mount Elbert was visible in the distance, a reminder of the peaks that define Colorado. The final stretch to the summit followed a cold, windy, mile-long ridge. Reaching the top brought a mix of exhilaration and relief, a reward for the hours of steady ascent.

Descending was much easier than climbing. The way back felt clearer, especially across the rocky sections, though the treeline seemed to stretch forever on the way down. Eventually, I returned to the parking lot, tired but satisfied, with another incredible 14'er checked off the list.
