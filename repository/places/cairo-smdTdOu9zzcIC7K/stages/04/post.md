We booked a guided tour to Saqqarra where we visited the Step Pyramid. At the complex surrounding the pyramid our guide got us free access to a tour of the tombs and we saw our first heiroglyphics in person. It was a short tour, but amazing nonetheless.

While our guide was informative about lots of things, we felt like we missed out on seeing more, like going underneath the Stepped pyramid and exploring the tunnels within. They said it wasn't that great and told us to skip it.
