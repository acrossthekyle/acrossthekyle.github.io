We walked to the Giza plateau since it was within a mile of where we were staying. The route was sketchy: we walked under highways, and through construction zones. The entrance to the plateau was hectic with lots of line-cutting, but we finally made it.

And there they were, the infamous wonders of the ancient world: the Great Pyramids of Giza. Pictures don't do it justice, these things were huge! Not only that, but we were able to walk through the ruins of other structures around
the pyramids as well. We were able to freely walk through other ruins nearby and see all of the pyramids up close and personal. But the best part was coming up: going into the Great Pyramid itself.

Once we got through the tunnels dug into the side of the pyramid, we entered the corridors built by the ancient Egyptians. These corridors were very tight and cramped. The Kings Chamber was our destination, and it was just like the pictures from our history books: plain and empty. But that doesn't matter, because we were standing inside the great pyramid!
