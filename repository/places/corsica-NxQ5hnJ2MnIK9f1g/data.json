  "description": [
    "Corsica feels bright and outdoorsy, with easy pedestrian access in the historic part of Porto-Vecchio and easy access to hiking in the nearby hills. Over on the west coast, Ajaccio has a more everyday vibe, with a busy harbor, cafe-lined streets, historic citadels, relaxing beaches, and mountains rising just behind the city."
