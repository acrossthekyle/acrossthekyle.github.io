Last night was one of the scariest I've had on the trail. Horses wandered into the campsite after everyone had gone to sleep, passing dangerously close to my tent. The full moon lit the area just enough to keep them from running into anything, but when dogs started barking, the horses bolted and galloped through the camp. I spent much of the night wide awake, heart racing.

The morning brought the final day on trail, though I didn't fully realize it yet. After several days of double-stage hikes, I wasn't sure I could handle nearly 20 miles, so I initially planned to stop at the last refuge. The early morning trail dropped into a valley, then crossed to the other side before leveling out. Waterfalls and tiny rivers punctuated the hike, but for the most part, the terrain was even and easy to navigate.

The path then led into a sun-exposed, desert-like section, and sure enough, I got lost again. Missing a trail marker sent me scrambling, bushwhacking, and climbing my way back to the correct route. From that point, I kept a sharp eye on markers as the trail climbed through a forested section and a large public park. The dirt path was wide and flat for a stretch, but eventually it gave way to another steep ascent toward a mountain top.

After countless ups and downs, I finally reached the last refuge on trail. The campsite was chaotic, with cows and horses wandering freely, so I decided not to stop. I pushed onward, even as my feet screamed in protest. Three hours of relentless climbing and descending later, I reached a rocky pass signaling the trail's end. A final 30-minute sprint downhill brought me to the paved road of Conca, and the official finish of the trek. I collapsed at a bar, celebrating with my first American hiker I'd met along the way.

Reflecting on this journey, I can say it was the hardest trek I have ever done, but also the most rewarding. I met incredible people, faced intense physical and mental challenges, and experienced some of the most beautiful terrain in the world. Completing this thru-hike also marked the culmination of a personal list of treks I set back in 2018, and finishing it brought an unmatched sense of accomplishment.
