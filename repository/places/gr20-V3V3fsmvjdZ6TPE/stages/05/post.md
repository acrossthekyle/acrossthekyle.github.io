Today promised to be an easier day than yesterday, and I started it with a breakfast of hot chocolate and bread with butter. I felt energized and ready to move quickly as we left the Auberge and headed onto the trail. The path wound through the trees and along rocky sections, offering plenty of lookout points to admire the expansive forested valley below. Small rivers fed by waterfalls crossed our path, and several fallen trees added some natural obstacles along the way.

After about 30 minutes, the trail shifted from dirt to rock and began a steep ascent up the mountainside. I took frequent breaks to catch my breath, but my knees were holding up well, though one of my knee pad straps was starting to fail. Halfway up, we stopped at a large waterfall to refill our bottles and soaked our hats in the ice-cold water, which was as refreshing as it sounds.

By 9:00 am, we reached the top of the col and finished the most challenging section of the day. The Mediterranean Sea was still visible from these high vantage points, a stunning reminder of how far we had come. We paused at Refuge Miori for a short break, where I tried my first Orangina, a sweet, fizzy drink similar to an over-the-top Fanta. The sugary boost was exactly what I needed for the remainder of the hike.

The descent from Refuge Miori was much easier, mostly dirt with a gentle slope. We passed a pair of cows resting in the bushes and paused to take in the view behind us, amazed at how far we had climbed in just an hour. Along the way, we came across cascading waterfalls and even stripped down to our underwear to take a quick, ice-cold swim on a flat rocky platform. It was invigorating and perfectly refreshing.

Later in the day, a herd of goats and their owners crossed the trail, slowing us for a short while before we reached a small food stand selling cheese-filled pancakes and lasagna. The pancakes were delicious and provided a much-needed snack. We continued through lush forests, occasionally speeding up to enjoy the trail, and finally arrived at our hotel. There, we relaxed with a deck of cards, bought some sturdier flip flops for around camp, and enjoyed the biggest dinner of the trip so far: steak with fries, egg salad, and dessert. Tomorrow promises to be the easiest day yet, but I'm already looking forward to every step.
