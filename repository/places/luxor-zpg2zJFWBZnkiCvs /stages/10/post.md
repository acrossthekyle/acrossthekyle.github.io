We walked down the Avenue of Sphinxes in order to reach the Karnak temple complex, and no one else was on the avenue, so we had it all to ourselves. It beat walking alogn the busy narrow streets.

Luxor was amazing, but Karnak was huge! This temple complex was expansive, tall, and the paintings on the walls were still in great condition. There were so many things to see here. We spent a long time walking around and checking
everything out.
