This was the highlight of our time in Luxor. We were picked up from our hotel at 4am, along with a bunch of others, and shuttled to a balloon ride launching area. We waited in the cold, dark, pre-dawn morning as teams of workers got the balloons ready for us. It was an amazing sight watching these huge things go from the flames burning within them.

Our time came and we were shuffled into the basket of our balloon with the most charistmatic captain one could hope for. After a quick run-through of the rules we were off and ascending into the air.

The captain had a little jingle he kept singing: "Everything I do, I do for you." It made us smile and laugh, and kept things cheery. The ride over the Valley of the Kings and Queens below us was amazing. The sunrise, the views, it was the
perfect ending to this vacation.
