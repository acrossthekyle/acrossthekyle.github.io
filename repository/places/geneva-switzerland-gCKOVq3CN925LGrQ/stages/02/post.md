From the outside the cathedral looks like a collection of different eras with massive columns seemingly glued onto a much older rugged-looking body. On the inside the interior was strikingly stark-looking with no ornate altars, just rows of plain wooden benches. However, there is one exception and that's the Chapel near the exit. It's a 'riot of color' with vibrant Gothic paintings and intricate carvings that felt like a secret treasure hidden in the grey stone.

The highlight of this cathedral though was the ability to go up into the twin spires and walk through the attic and old school room near the top, including being able to get up close to the massive old church bells. For a small fee you get to see the entire city. The climb up was through narrow spiraling stone stairs, and we were even able to walk along expored exterior walkways.

When we were there the archaeological site underground was sadly closed due to construction and renovations. It would have been really awesome.
