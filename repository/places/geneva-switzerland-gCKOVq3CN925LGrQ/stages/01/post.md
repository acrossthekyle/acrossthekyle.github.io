Located where the lake meets the Rhône River, and originally built as a safety valve for a local hydraulic plant, the Jet d'Eau is a massive plume of water that shoots 450 feet into the air, visible from nearly anywhere in the city, making it a majestic centerpiece. It's even more incredible looking in person than the picture. I captured this shot of it from the spires of the Saint-Pierre cathedral.
