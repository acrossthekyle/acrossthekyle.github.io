    "The city feels calm, with the lakefront and the Jet d'Eau giving a bright, open feel, while cobbled streets in the Old Town offer history and charm. Parks, cafes, and waterfront paths make it easy to enjoy the outdoors without leaving the city, and the surrounding Alps and Jura mountains are always visible in the distance."
