A good thru-hike always begins with the familiar mix of anticipation and nerves, full backpack, fresh clothes, and the uneasy excitement of walking toward the starting point. I left my hotel in Glasgow at 7 a.m., stomach empty and mind buzzing with questions about what the day would bring. First priority: breakfast. Luckily, a familiar fast-food spot came to the rescue. I grabbed a quick meal and hurried to the train station, determined not to be late on day one.

Navigating the station was straightforward, though the local platform required a bit of detective work. The train arrived on time, and I found a seat across from another hiker carrying a large pack. A simple question about the West Highland Way sparked an instant connection. We would hike together for the first day before parting ways on the second. A short ride later, we arrived in Drymen, and the first order of business was securing a proper breakfast at a local grocery store before heading to the trailhead.

The start of the West Highland Way did not disappoint. A small obelisk and an archway with the trail's name marked the beginning in a way that felt celebratory. After some quick photos, we set off, walking first through the town's outskirts before entering open farm fields and pastures. Stone walls, wooden fences, and green hills stretched out in all directions, while trail markers guided our path. Clouds hung heavy overhead, threatening rain, but thankfully the weather held as we passed rivers, trees, and fields teeming with wildlife.

By noon, we stopped at a charming trail-side café, "Turnip the Beet," for a well-earned lunch. The sandwich was easily one of the best I'd had on the trail. Soon after, a light mist fell, prompting rain coats for a short stretch before the sun returned. Afternoon walking brought more pastoral scenery, with cows, sheep, and ducks keeping us company. Even a fenced-off "Trolls Bridge" added a touch of whimsy to the hike. Eventually, the dirt trail gave way to a quiet farm road, leading us to our first campsite just outside Drymen.

We arrived around 3 p.m., set up camp, and enjoyed the relief of hot showers. After a snack and some rest, we cooked a simple pre-made dinner on the stove. Later, my hiking companion suggested a short trip into town for a pint, which provided a small taste of local life before returning to the farm. As the sun set, I settled into my tent, ready for an early start the next day, eager to continue the adventure along Loch Lomond's scenic shores. Day one had set the tone: challenging yet rewarding, with spectacular views and a sense of camaraderie that only the trail can provide.
