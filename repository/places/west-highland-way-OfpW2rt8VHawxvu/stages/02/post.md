The day began under a bright, cloudy sky. A promising start after a night of restless sleep. I packed up my tent and gear, then cooked a quick breakfast of oatmeal with dehydrated bananas on my compact stove, carefully balancing it on a rock to avoid the damp grass. My hiking companion from yesterday decided to take it slow, so I set off alone, ready to tackle the day's route with energy and anticipation.

The trail led out of Drymen and quickly veered from the road onto a dirt path winding between two farms. Green fields dotted with yellow flowers gave way to rolling hills and forested preserves, where wide gravel paths cut through pine woods and areas of regrowth from past disturbances. The path gradually narrowed again into rocky dirt trails, offering glimpses of the Loch in the distance, though the route circled around before turning toward the massive hills ahead.

Crossing a small stream, the trail soon transitioned to stone steps, signaling the start of a climb up the hillside. The path zig-zagged and looped, with fields and sporadic tree clusters surrounding me. After about twenty minutes of scrambling over loose dirt, I finally reached the top, greeted by expansive views of the Loch below and a sky that had cleared into soft, pillowy clouds. I paused briefly for photos and a quick snack before descending toward the town below.

The descent was straightforward, though the trail was busy with weekend hikers. By noon, I reached a restaurant at the edge of the water for a well-earned lunch: a burger, fries, and a cold beer. After refueling I continued on the afternoon section of the hike. The trail climbed again, weaving through dense, warm woodland and eventually following the shoreline of the Loch, where the stony beaches stretched alongside the water.

By late afternoon, I arrived at my reserved campsite on the beach, with sweeping views of the surrounding hills and mountains. I spent the evening setting up my tent against the gusty winds, hanging clothes to dry, reading, and taking a nap. A peaceful stroll along the water completed the day, which had offered a perfect mix of varied terrain, spectacular scenery, and satisfying meals. It was a thoroughly rewarding day on the trail, one that reminded me why I love long-distance hiking.
