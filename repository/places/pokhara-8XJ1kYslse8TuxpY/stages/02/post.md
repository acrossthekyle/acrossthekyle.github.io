The World Peace Pagoda (Shanti Stupa) is perched on a hill called Anadu Hill at an altitude of 3,600 feet. The massive white dome stands as a literal beacon of peace overlooking the entire valley.

Getting there was was half the adventure. I chose the 'classic' route: a serene boat ride across Lake Phewa followed by a steep, hour-long hike through the lush Rani Ban forest. The trail is mostly stone stairs that wind through pines and wildflowers, providing just enough of a workout to make reaching the top feel earned.

Once I reached the top, the views were staggering. The skies weren't as clear as they could have been, but I could just barely make out the Annapurna massif and the distinct 'Fishtail' peak of Machhapuchhre in the distance. The pagoda itself is brilliant white with golden accents, featuring four statues of Buddha gifted from Japan, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Nepal, each representing a different stage of his life.

Walking clockwise around the upper tier in silence (the whole area is intentionally kept quiet to allow for medication), I felt the 'spiritual calm' that visitors often talk about.
