    "The Tour du Mont Blanc, or TMB, is a hiking route that encircles the Mont Blanc mountain in the Alps, passing through three different countries: France, Italy and Switzerland. It's around 100 miles long, with a lot of elevation gain/loss and it is considered a classic long-distance hiking trail, offering a unique blend of cultures, and stunning scenery.",
    "Shortly after completing the Camino in Spain I set off in September of 2018 to do this thru-hike. Along the route there are places called Refuges in the mountains where I spent each night. Amenities varied at each place, but they all included a bed, a full bathroom, and meals. The sights during the day are amazing, and the effort I put in during each day made every sight and sound worth it. I did some of the alternate routes on the trail, and my total distance came out to %distance% over %length% days, and the elevation changes ended up being %gain% up and %loss% down. I can't wait to do it again.",
    "These pictures showcase my time on trail, and offer a glimpse into the %length% days spent on this thru-hike."
