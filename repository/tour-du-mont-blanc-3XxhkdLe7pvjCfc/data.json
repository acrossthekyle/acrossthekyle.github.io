  "description": [
    "Encircling the Mont Blanc mountain in the Alps, the tour of this peak is a classic long-distance hike passing through France, Italy, and Switzerland that offered a challenging experience filled with diverse landscapes, a unique blend of cultures, and stunning alpine charm. I slept in comfy mountain huts and ate warm meals every night.",
    "The sights from the trail, and at the mountain huts, are beautiful and well worth the daily gain and loss of thousands of feet in elevation."
