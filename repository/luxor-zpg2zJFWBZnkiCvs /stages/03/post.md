Entering the Tomb of Tutankhamun feels different from the others: it is remarkably small compared to the vast corridors of the other kings in the valley. You can really sense the haste in which it was prepared. Unlike the other pharaohs who were moved to museums long ago, Tutankhamun himself remains here. I stood inches away from his actual mummy, which is now preserved in a glass case at one end of the burial chamber. Seeing his linen-wrapped form in the very place he was laid 3,000 years ago is amazing.

This was the only room in the tomb with decorated walls. The yellow-background murals are vibrant, showing the boy-king being welcomed into the afterlife by Osiris and Anubis. His massive quartzite sarcophagus still dominates the room, though it is now empty of its famous nesting golden coffins.
