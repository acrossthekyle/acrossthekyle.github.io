I had a few days to kill in Nepal after I conquered my thru-hike of the Annapurna Circuit, and I spent them in Pokhara (the outdoor activity capital of Nepal). First thing the next day after arriving in town I headed towards the lake that most of the touristy area of the city lies along.

The highlight was hiring a brightly painted wooden boat, or doonga, to row out onto the water and head towards the far shore where I made a stop at the 'World Peace Pagoda' (Shanti Stupa).

The lake itself is a lovely and tranquil place to walk along in the morning before the city wakes up and the roadway in front of it becomes choked with mopeds and motorcycles.
