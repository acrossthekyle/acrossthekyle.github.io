Today would be a really short day. I set off early in the morning just after
breakfast and began the mostly downward trail towards a jeep station where
I would hitch a ride back to Pokhara. I did however enjoy a nice sunrise on my
little private balcony.

Not many people were on this part of the trail today as I passed through
several small groupings of teahouses and through bright green scenery. There were
a few areas where I had to walk on a road, but luckily no vehicles came through.
Lots of lovely trees in this area though.

I was making good time, now eager to get back to my stuff at the Hostel, and a
hot shower. I had decided, last night, to book a different hostel that looked
much nicer and that offered excursions such as paragliding.

The jeep station was a simple place that offered cold drinks and a shaded area
with benches to wait at while a car arrived. I didn't have to wait long though.
The journey back to Pokhara was split up into two parts: the first was the
jeep ride down the rough mountain dirt road (the car was bouncing all over
the place). We had to wait for a little bit at one point as crews worked to clear
a fresh landslide. The second part of the journey came after the jeep went about
halfway down the mountain, and was on paved roads. Here they pulled into a
parking lot and I was transferred to a pre-paid taxi that took me the rest of
the way down to Pokhara.

My adventure in the Himalayas was done. This was an amazing experience. I met
some amazing friends that I keep in touch with, and had saw some amazing things.
The world and culture of the Himalayas is very pleasant and relaxing. I wish
I could keep doing this forever. And not to mention the near-death experience a
few nights ago. This will go down as one of my favorite experiences and places,
and maybe someday I'll work up the courage to come back and attempt the Everest
Basecamp trek that is also very popular.
