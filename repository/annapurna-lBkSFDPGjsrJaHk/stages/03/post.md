Today was filled with sun and some of the best mo-mo we've had on the trail so far. The terrain was varied, alternating between long flat stretches and constant elevation gains. We left Jagat and steadily climbed, following the side of a deep valley that offered a mix of lush scenery and small waterfalls along the way.

After about four hours of steady climbing, the trail brought us to the riverbed we had been hiking alongside for the past two days. Walking along stony beaches toward a village perched on the water's edge, we stopped for a long lunch. The mo-mo here was hands down the best of the trip, a true highlight for half of us who are vegetarian. One of the local children spent much of the meal chasing their pet rabbit around, adding charm to the experience.

After lunch, it was back into the mountains as the trail began to climb again. Two hours later, we arrived in Dharapani. Finding an affordable place to stay took some effort, and the village experienced intermittent power outages throughout the evening, a common occurrence in Nepal's mountains.

Although the day's details blur a bit in memory, the combination of sun, scenic valleys, riverbeds, and memorable mo-mo made it another unforgettable day on the circuit. It reminded us that some days are best experienced rather than documented.
