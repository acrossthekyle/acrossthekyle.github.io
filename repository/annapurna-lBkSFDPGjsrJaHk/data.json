  "description": [
    "The Annapurna Circuit is a circular route that goes around the Annapurna Mountain (one of the eight tallest peaks in the world). The trail gets it start in the subtropical forests along paddy fields and waterfalls at 2,500 feet, and ascends all the way up to the frozen Arctic region at 17,800 feet reaching the Tibetan plateau.",
    "I went during the (second) best time of the year, from October to November, in order to have the most favorable weather and trail conditions. The circuit, including the main trail and side trails we used for acclimatizing on rest days (such as in Manang), and the trek to basecamp, totaled %distance%, and took %length% days to complete while hiking the trail in a counter-clockwise direction. This direction of travel allows you to slowly ease into the daily altitude gain, and which made it easier when crossing the highest point between Phedi and Muktinath, at %max%. The total gain and loss in elevation for this trail was %gain% up, and %loss% down, making it one of the harder treks I have done.",
    "These pictures showcase my time on trail, and offer a glimpse into the %length% days spent on this thru-hike."
