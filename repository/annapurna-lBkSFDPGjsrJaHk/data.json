  "description": [
    "Surrounded by giants, and ranging from subtropical forests and waterfalls along paddy fields at 2,500 feet to the frozen arctic region of the Tibetan plateau at 17,000 feet, the Annapurna Circuit wound its way around the Annapurna mountain (one of the eight tallest peaks in the world) of the Himalayas in Nepal.",
    "The sheer amount of elevation gain and loss each day, and changing biomes, led to this being one of my toughest treks, and nearly succumbing to hypothermia while hiking up to Ghorepani didn't help. These pictures showcase my time on trail."
