Geneva has a great, free, botanic garden a short bus ride away from the bustling downtown area. We spent a couple of hours wandering its paths as they wove their way through differently themed areas, seeing all of the different types of flora they were cultivating.

The greenhouses were a real treat. They offered a tour of different climates, from lush tropical rainforests with high banana trees to stark desert landscapes filled with massive cacti. There were also little ponds inside with koi fish.

There was a little animal park at the northern end, but we didn't get see much wildlife.

This was a genuine green oasis away from the urban hustle and bustle.
