I woke up while it was still dark, and the campsite was damp with condensation from clouds that had rolled in overnight. Packing up was quick since today ended at a hotel, and I was looking forward to a warm shower and dry clothes. The ascent out of the refuge was steep, and a fog slowly crept in, obscuring the trail, but the views from the top made it worth every step. From that high vantage point, I watched clouds roll over the ridge below while the sun shone behind them, creating the most stunning cloud inversion I have ever seen. I lingered there for a long time, completely captivated.

The remainder of the climb to the day's high point was manageable, but the descent on the other side was treacherous. My ankles twisted as I navigated smooth rocks and leapt from boulder to boulder along the steep path. It felt relentless at times, yet eventually the trail flattened out, and the final stretch wound through peaceful forest. The transition into a forest preserve with wide gravel paths made the walk almost effortless.

Arriving at the hotel at 10:45 am was a little early, so I waited for the room to be ready. I passed the time at a local bar in town, a tiny cluster of buildings with a train station, enjoying drinks and snacks. Prices were surprisingly high for such a small place, even higher than at the mountain refuges. Once the room was ready, I laid out my gear to air, took a long shower, and indulged in a nap as rain gently fell outside.

Dinner followed soon after, and though it was nothing extravagant, it hit the spot after a long morning on the trail. I had time to relax and appreciate the comforts of a proper hotel, from laundry to a soft bed. Breakfast is set for 7:00 am tomorrow, giving me a later start, which works fine since the day is only a five-hour hike. It's a nice chance to catch my breath and recharge before continuing the trek.
