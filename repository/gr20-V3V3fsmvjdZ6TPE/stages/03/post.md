Rain greeted us overnight, sending campers scrambling to pull hanging laundry and backpacks inside their tents. I was up early, packed, and on the trail by 7 a.m., ready to face another challenging day. Just like the previous days, the trail started steep and required plenty of bouldering, testing both balance and stamina.

I paced myself better with water breaks today, even without any water sources along the trail, and I actually managed to eat most of my packed lunch, a couscous-based mix that kept me fueled for the climb ahead. Once at the summit, it was time to descend over steep drops and rough rock. From this vantage point, the coast and Calenzana were visible far below, and we enjoyed our lunch on an exposed rocky platform while taking in the view of where we would be staying that night.

The journey down took about an hour and a half and felt far more pleasant than the previous day. Most of the descent was through large, well-spaced forest trees, allowing a cool breeze to flow through. After several switchbacks and sections where we had to choose our own route, we finally reached the bottom. Some in our group had booked rooms at the nearby hotel, while others, including me, pitched tents in a shaded, flat spot ideal for camping.

Despite being mostly vegetarian, I couldn't resist the call of fries and a burger at the hotel restaurant. It was satisfying, and I followed it with a long, much-needed nap in the cool summer breeze. To prepare for tomorrow, I treated myself to a fancy buffet breakfast at the hotel instead of the lighter fare offered at the refuges. With a long day ahead, I plan to wake around 5:00 a.m. to get an early start.
