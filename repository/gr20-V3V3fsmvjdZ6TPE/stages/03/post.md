It rained overnight, and the first rain drops signaled a mad scramble to bring hanging laundry and backpacks into their tents. There were a lot of early risers today, and I was on the trail by 7am after packing up and eating breakfast.

Just like yesterday, and the day before, it was straight up with most of the trail requiring bouldering.

I did a better job today with water breaks, even without any water sources on trail, and actually ate most of the packed lunch. The main entree was couscous, mixed with other things.

Once at the top it was time to go down over steep drops, and over rough rock. From up here though we can still see the coast, and Calenzana. We ate lunch on an exposed rocky platform where we could see the place we were staying at tonight far, far, down below.

The journey down from the top took about one and a half hours, but it was a lot more pleasant today than it was yesterday; it was mostly through forests but the trees were large, very large, and spaced out so that a nice breeze could make its way in. After several switchbacks and multiple choose-your-own- adventure trail sections we made it to the bottom. Some of our group had booked rooms in the hotel, and the rest of us were camping. I found a good flat tent spot with a nice amount of shade.

I'm a vegetarian, mostly, but when someone told me they had fries and a burger, I rushed over to the restaurant at the hotel. It was so good, hit the spot. Afterwards I took a nice much needed nap in the cool summer breeze.

I ordered a fancy buffet breakfast at the hotel next to the camping area because the breakfasts at the refuges aren't that fulfilling. It's supposed to be a long day tomorrow, so I'm going to try and wake up early, around 5:00 am.
