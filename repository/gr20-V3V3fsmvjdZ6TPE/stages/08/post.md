I slept alright. The wind was a pain, and I had to put on my pants over my shorts, and put on a pullover, but overall I was alright. The temperature got as low as 53ËšF, and the wind chill was probably 15+ degrees colder. Good news though: the sleep system worked well, and the tent also held up.

During our breakfast of jam on toast and chocolate milk (oh so healthy) I was able to see some cloud inversion. Always a treat.

The descent was initially very steep and we had to use our trekking poles as braces while hoping down from ledge to ledge, and down the various switchbacks. But eventually it became a more gradual and pleasant descent. We passed by many waterfalls as we went, and lots of cows were in the area keeping us company.

Just before the halfway point we took a break at a Bergerie that sold quiche! But, to be honest, their cheese was awful. I couldn't stomach it and had to give it away. Their bread was decent though.

The trail just before and after the Bergerie was amazing because it was flat, and went through forests filled with tall trees spaced far apart. A large river ran beside us over smooth boulders as we worked our way down. At the bottom of the trail there was a bridge over the river and below this bridge was another makeshift swimming area. We did some swimming in the waterfall/river, and it was much colder than the other swimming hole. Some of us even jumped off of the bridge into the river below.

It would take about another hour to get up to the refuge through some gradual and then steep hiking, mostly over a wide trail just after the swimming hole and then over more narrower and rockier paths that slowly gained up the green hills around us. The camping at the refuge was in a grassy field, so it's easier to get a better tent pitch, but it's still not perfect.

Finally, the first cold shower of the trip! I was wondering when this would happen. The number of hot showers on this trek was too good to be true! We played some more card games to pass the time before dinner, with some naps mixed in. Dinner was delayed for nearly an hour after we were seated, and the lasagna was just ok, in my opinion. Luckily we got seconds though. And dessert was chocolate mouse!

After dinner our group said their goodbyes since we're all splitting up after today. It was very sad. These people were awesome, and tons of fun. Some are doing a double tomorrow, while others are taking a rest day in the town of Vizzavona. I had a hotel room booked there though, and I was eager to make use of their laundry services.

It's gonna be a chilly night tonight.
