I slept reasonably well despite the persistent wind, bundling up with pants over my shorts and a pullover to stay warm. The temperature dropped to 53˚F, and the wind made it feel at least 15 degrees colder, but my sleep system and tent held up perfectly. Breakfast was jam on toast with chocolate milk, and I was treated to a beautiful cloud inversion: a rare and stunning sight in the early morning.

The descent started off steep, requiring careful navigation from ledge to ledge using trekking poles for support. Eventually, the trail eased into a more gradual downhill, passing countless waterfalls and grazing cows along the way. Before reaching the halfway point, we stopped at a Bergerie to try their quiche. The cheese was disappointing, but the bread was solid, and the break gave us a chance to rest before continuing.

After the Bergerie, the trail became a dream for walking. The flat path cut through a forest of tall, widely spaced trees, with a wide river running beside us over smooth boulders. At the bottom, a bridge spanned the river and beneath it lay a swimming spot where we braved the icy water. Some even jumped from the bridge into the river, embracing the chill before beginning the next climb.

The final push to the refuge involved a gradual ascent over wide trails and then narrower, rockier paths as we worked our way up green hills. Camping was set in a grassy field, which made pitching a tent much easier, though not perfect. I finally took my first cold shower of the trip, definitely a refreshing change from the many hot showers we'd enjoyed so far.

Dinner was slightly delayed, and while the lasagna was just okay, seconds were available, and dessert was chocolate mousse. Afterward, our group said goodbye as everyone split up for the next day. Some planned a double hike while others rested in Vizzavona. I had a hotel room waiting there, eager to take advantage of their laundry services. The night promised to be chilly, but it felt good to reflect on a day full of waterfalls, swimming, and shared memories with friends I'd made along the trail.
