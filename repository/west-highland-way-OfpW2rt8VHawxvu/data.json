  "description": [
    "Filled with misty glens, deep lochs, and endless rain while hiking from Milngavie to Fort William, the West Highland Way long-distance trail in the highlands of Scotland. The trail crosses many ancient roads, and old coaching routes, journeying from the lowlands to the highlands, while camping overnight in fields, along a lakeside beach, and under a bridge.",
    "I was not prepared for the amount of rain that would be dropped on me on nearly every day of the trek, and by the end of it I was chilled to the bone, but I did witness some amazing mountains once I got up into the Highlands. Here are the days I spent on trail showcasing the varied landscapes and scenery."
