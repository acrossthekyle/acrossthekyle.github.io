    "The West Highland Way is a long-distance trail in the highlands of Scotland, running from Milngavie north of Glasgow to Fort William, covering %distance%. The trail utilizes many ancient roads, and old coaching routes. I walked from south to north, making it a journey from the Lowlands to the Highlands. The route took me %length% days to complete while camping overnight in fields, on a beach along a lake, and under a bridge.",
    "I went in May of 2022 when the weather is supposedly favorable, and the nasty insects known as Midges aren't out yet. I was not prepared for the amount of rain that would be dropped on me on nearly every day of the trek, and by the end of it I was chilled to the bone and soaked through-n-through. Surprisngly this trek didn't end up being a favorite of mine, but I did see some amazing mountain scenery once I got up into the Highlands.",
    "Here are the days I spent on trail showcasing the varied landscapes and scenery."
