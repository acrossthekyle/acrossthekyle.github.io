The morning greeted me with a much drier outlook than the previous day. While dark gray clouds still lingered, patches of blue were beginning to peek through the sky. After a hearty traditional English breakfast, I shouldered my backpack and set off a bit later than usual at 8:30 a.m., ready to take advantage of the improving weather.

The trail was still dotted with puddles from yesterday's downpour, making navigation a bit of a zig-zagging game. I occasionally skimmed the tops of puddles, but a slightly damp toe was far preferable to a fully soaked shoe. Waterfalls and rivers were raging from the recent rain, creating some tricky rock-hopping crossings, though nothing too hazardous. Soon enough, the trail climbed into dryer pastures, leaving the watery challenges behind.

Much of the morning was spent walking briskly through yellow-grass fields and rolling hills, occasionally passing the ruins of old buildings. By 11 a.m., I had gained elevation above the fields and enjoyed wide, sweeping views of the surrounding mountains and valleys. Thickening clouds hinted that rain might return, and a gentle fog began to descend, adding a mysterious quality to the landscape. A short stretch through pine and conifer woods, with streams and vibrant greenery, offered a peaceful contrast to the open hills, though the serenity ended abruptly when I emerged into a deforested area, a stark reminder of human impact on even the most scenic trails.

After navigating a series of stone bridges and small wooded patches, I returned to open green fields flanked by mountains, truly a spectacular sight even under heavy clouds. By 12:30 p.m., I reached my initially planned stopping point but, feeling energized and seeing the sky clearing, decided to push on toward Bridge of Orchy, a town I had planned to reach the following day. A lunch stop in a larger town at 1:30 p.m. refueled me before the trail carried me back into the mountains under bright sunshine. Wide, level paths made for fast progress, allowing me to cover impressive distance through dramatic hills and peaks.

I arrived in Bridge of Orchy around 4:30 p.m., exhausted but exhilarated after a long day of walking. The campground was set along the river beside the town's namesake bridge, offering level spots for tents and access to proper bathroom facilities. I set up my tent, captured a few photos of the bridge and surrounding countryside, cooked dinner, and let my feet recover at a park table alongside fellow hikers. Rain returned around 7 p.m., a signal to retreat into the tent, but it was a satisfying end to a day full of wide vistas, varied terrain, and excellent progress. Only two days left on the trail now, and today had been a great one.
