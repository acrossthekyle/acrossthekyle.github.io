Early in the morning the beach belongs to the joggers, dog walkers, and a few dedicated kitesurfers preparing for the afternoon winds. The sand is wide and golden, stretching between the turquoise Atlantic and the low-rise guest houses of the local neighborhood. It was our favorite thing to do each morning. We walked from one end of the beach to the other, sometimes crossing over private condominium grounds to get to the other section of beach.
