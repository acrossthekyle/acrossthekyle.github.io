We decided to walk from our hotel to Castillo San Felipe del Morro. It was a long trek, taking well over an hour, but it provided an incredible transition from the casual beach scene to the deep history of Old San Juan.

The walk into Old San Juan proper can be a bit tricky in some sections, but once we entered the old city walls and made our way to the fort's grounds, the ambiance shifted entirely. The sprawling green lawn leading up to the fortress entrance was alive with families flying colorful kites in the strong Atlantic breeze.

The fort was massive, a true architectural marvel built by the Spanish over 250 years, starting in 1539. It sits 140 feet above the sea, designed to unleash devastating crossfire on enemy ships trying to enter San Juan Bay.

Everywhere the views were breathtaking. From the upper levels, you get sweeping panoramas of the Atlantic Ocean, the colorful La Perla neighborhood below, and the nearby cemetery. The iconic garitas, or sentry boxes, are everywhere, making for the perfect selfie spot.

We explored all six levels of the fort, navigating ramps, spiral stairs, and dark tunnels. Inside, we saw replicated military barracks, a chapel, and storerooms that really helped us imagine what life was like for the soldiers stationed here centuries ago.
