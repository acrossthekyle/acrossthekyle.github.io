The air was crisp as we adjusted our packs at the Blue Spring Lake trailhead this morning. This 5.5 mile stretch of the Ice Age Trail is exactly what I wanted: a gentle introduction to overnight backpacking for me and my partner.

The Blue Spring Lake Segment didn't waste any time showing off. Almost immediately we were climbing. The trail here twists through dense oak forests with a ruggedness that caught my calves by surprise, with near constant up and down portions as we went over several kettles and morraines left behind by the glaciars from long ago.

The highlight was definitely Bald Bluff. Standing at 1,050 feet, we had a panoramic view of the Southern Kettle Moraine that made the steep ascent worth every breath. As I transitioned into the Stony Ridge Segment, the terrain leveled out into a more 'Midwest Nice' rhythm.

Finally we arrived at Stony Ridge Shelter #2. It's a classic Adirondack-style lean-to perched on a ridge with a solid view of the surrounding kettle depressions. We pitched our tent inside of the shelter. After a day of climbing one hill after another and navigating over tangled tree roots, the quiet of the woods here is the perfect end to the trek.

The next day we repeated the path to the shelter which didn't seem to take as long as the intial hike out to it.
