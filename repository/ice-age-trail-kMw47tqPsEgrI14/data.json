  "description": [
    "The Ice Age Trail is a long-distance National Scenic Trail spanning 1,200 miles across Wisconsin in North America, traversing the state in a series of segments (or sections) that roughly form a 'U' shape, from the northeast corner, down to the south, and back up to the northwestern edge bordering the state of Minnesota. It gets its name from the numerous kettles and moraines left behind by the glaciers.",
    "So far I have completed %length% sections over %days% days totalling %distance%. The overall gain and loss of elevation is low on these trails, but it's the constant up and down over the small rolling hills that start to wear you down. These pictures showcase the mostly forested sections of the trail I've done so far."
