    "A place of kettles and moraines from mile-thick glaciers long ago, completing this 1,200 mile long-distance national scenic trail in sections takes time. To date I've completed %length% sections over %days% and %distance%. It's not the distance on this trail that gets you; it's the constant up and down over rolling hills."
